# CS224n-2019-Solutions

## Intro
Here are my quick notes and solutions for Standford CS224n 2019 nlp course.

Notes are just some screenshots and shothand when watching videos for quick lookup.

Assignments(coding and writing) are completed except a3 since I did not understand dependency parsing quite well. Both a4 and a5 have been trained on corpus, and bleu is above 21.5 but lower than 22.5(full mark baseline in a5), so there may be a few bugs, or hyperparameters to fine tune. Data are not uploaded, all assignments and data can be downloaded on course website.

## Resources
Many thanks to official website [CS224n](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1194/index.html#schedule) and [video(zh)](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1r4411f7td?from=search&seid=7846450317972720872). The video captions are machine-translated but enough to be understood. For native speakers, [video(en)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rXD5-xhemo&list=PLoROMvodv4rOhcuXMZkNm7j3fVwBBY42z) is available. Other resources are all mentioned in course website and lectures.
