You know what I do is write for children, and in fact, I'm probably the author for children, I read in the United States.
And I always tell people that I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can believe it as a farmer, or <unk> clothes and no one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that one <unk> is generally something that fell into some place.
You just have to turn to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the 1960s in the average school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of the class.
When I went to bleed every week in the <unk> <unk> until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life to let me walk into the bathroom room <unk>
I was doing it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
He had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the '60s, I felt the need to start working in organizations fighting AIDS.
About three or four years ago, I got a phone call from that <unk> lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm sure, as adults never get to know us.
You could go back to Ohio, and please bring that man that I know you have found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> ovarian cancer, and I'd like you to stick with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see, we got <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
And we found a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and we handed off his family, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And so the woman I wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> he became a box of ashes and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had closed, it had become a circle -- and that <unk> that I told you the present thing did in itself.
The epiphany is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that I was talking about a lot of this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to realize that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time, almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly be <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
The <unk> around me, <unk> of the water almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't even think it was a <unk> on another <unk> on a <unk> year after year.
The <unk> are born when they fall out of the glaciers or the walls of ice.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them refuse to <unk> and they hold onto the end, while others can't afford it, more and <unk> in a <unk> of passionate passion.
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated separated and in as much as we see us sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As an <unk> melts a <unk> I'm breathing your atmosphere <unk>
As an iceberg, you send fresh freshwater in minerals that feeds a lot of life.
And I come across to photograph these <unk> as if it was trying to do the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments there are only in this way and will not have that way again.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its way through the life cycle.
Part of the ice that I photograph is very <unk> it's got a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures that I'd like to show you are from an iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's very little frequent to come to witness a <unk>
Here you go.
You can see on the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts <unk> the ship has moved to the other side and the man is standing up there.
This is a <unk> <unk>
<unk> of water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single man, a baby. Okay.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to get too much on the details of conception, because if they stop thinking about the conception of understanding -- I'm not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and sperm joins up into the X <unk>
And in the other case, the X <unk> of sperm joins into the X <unk> chromosome.
Both <unk> and it starts life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my living activity -- I would play two roles.
In one of my <unk> I work with the story of anatomy.
I'm a <unk> in training and what I study in this case is the way people define the anatomy -- that are the anatomy of human bodies, and how you would have considered the body <unk> the idea of <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients, or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> <unk>
In this case, I've been working with people whose physical features defy social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with fraternal twins two people inside one body.
I've been working with people with <unk> people much higher than the average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with chronic sex -- individuals whose physics of physics are not functioning in male <unk> and conventional female <unk>
In <unk> we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> takes a lot of ways.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways of having a sex that doesn't lie in the male and male or <unk>
For example, it's the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> which is the <unk> <unk> which tells you that we all have in the <unk> life that would become <unk>
And then, in the <unk> life, the testes is producing testosterone.
But because this individual lacks <unk> <unk> body doesn't react to the same.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So there's high levels of testosterone -- but not reaction.
As a consequence, the body develops in a <unk> course as a <unk>
When you <unk> the baby has a little girl.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, it's growing up and developing the breasts.
After doing examinations realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has <unk> and <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not like that.
Women like men, we have in the body something called areolar <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the <unk> hormone.
Most of the women as I -- I think a <unk> woman knows her <unk> <unk> I think being a typical woman most women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> who has <unk> syndrome.
So sex is a complicated thing, and it's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in a certain way can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old who was born and raised like <unk> had girlfriend, and sex with her, he was wearing a life as a boy and I had just found that I had <unk> and <unk>
I had an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
It had 20th chromosomes and in the uterus -- the <unk> glands were so active that, in essence, creating a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, his genitals were <unk> his brain was exposed to the hormone component typically male <unk>
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> nothing.
And it was 19 years when he started to have medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors found that, in fact, was a woman on the inside.
Well, another example of a case of <unk>
Some people with 20th chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> is to say, have tissue <unk> wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't really know why that happens.
So there are many varieties of sex.
The reason why children with this kind of bodies -- if they are <unk> fraternal twins or <unk> it <unk> to surgery, it's not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why you get to various surgeries are a threat to our social categories.
The system is usually based on the idea that a particular anatomy has <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have an identity <unk> <unk> to be black wants to have African anatomy in historic terms.
A terribly simplistic idea.
And when we present a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with the <unk>
So we have very careful ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of the <unk> very romantic.
Imagine how amazing it is to have kids who are born like two people inside one body.
The highest recent case is from the past year with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> put in <unk> for her sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of reporters were calling up to wonder: "What are they going to do to determine whether you <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the reporters who don't have such a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't tracing a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> we're us who draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more technologically advances, more we have to admit that these categories -- that we thought were categories of <unk> which are <unk> directly with <unk> categories, are much more <unk> than they are <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
It's also in terms of race, something that happens much more complicated than the spinal <unk>
So as we see, we go into an <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What did they find?
And as we <unk> in science we go deeper into a very awkward area where we have to recognize that <unk> categories that are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all sorts of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States of today, are the struggles at the beginning and in the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body gets human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> <unk> today, not in public, but I know inside the <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to <unk> with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of it, they put a pen in front of the nose, and if I did not get it yet.
If I stopped moving the <unk>
But today we can say, for example, extract life from a body and putting them into another body.
And as a result, we have to deal with the dilemma of really determining somebody's death, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe think that this explosion of <unk> could be happy to someone like me.
In politics I am progressive, <unk> people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit to me to be able to admit that.
<unk> that these categories are much more fragile than we thought about <unk>
<unk> from the notion of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension -- I have to admit that I'm a developer with a <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did, I find every kind of thing to see that musical <unk> <unk> and not the music, which is totally <unk>
That's why it happened in <unk> with the <unk>
I <unk> them up, the earliest activists of the anatomy and tell them why.
What they <unk> was an <unk> concept and <unk> it with another which was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as everybody remembers what we <unk> our <unk> <unk> was the idea of <unk> The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
<unk> of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of the birth of the birth of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the political power was coming into the heart of blood passed from the grandfather to the father and then the son, etc.
The <unk> <unk> rejected that idea and to replace it by a new organizational concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the field of play, and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the common anatomy and not the differences, but it was something very radical.
And in part of it, they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time -- the science of science.
And it stays very clear, if you look at the history of <unk> <unk> which many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to call it from a <unk> right idea.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look at it, for example, the Declaration of Independence talking about nature and God of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, they were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future rights movement.
They didn't think of that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And the women.
Then the success of the Civil Rights Movement with people from the <unk> of <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights Movement and saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people of color that were attached to the <unk> <unk> about the <unk> and again, <unk>
We see the same with the Movement of <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we need to start asking us to ask why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For instance, I don't want to give a fish the same rights to a human.
I don't mean that we should stop anatomy.
I don't want to say that the five-year-old kids would have to have sex or <unk>
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me they have sense and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why keep them and make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two things that we saw at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, what, was born three months before time: June 1 1980.
So Henry, on the contrary, he was born the one in March of 1980.
By the one of the fact that I was born three months before Mary told all the rights three months before Henry -- the right to women's consent, sex the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but was born afterwards.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
So Henry, in virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you whether it's <unk> in virtue of being a man who is now <unk> from the <unk> <unk> which Mary doesn't have to worry about.
<unk> on its part, has no same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman just in some states.
So there are still categories <unk> that in various aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science contributed both in the field of anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time I feel like science is going to be <unk>
Where do we go from here?
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of attitude attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are trapped in a strange position.
For example, Texas at a certain time has decided that to marry a man you don't have to have chromosome <unk> and to marry a woman you have to have Y chromosome.
Now, in practice, they don't make people tests by people.
But this is also very strange because the story I told you about the beginning of <unk> syndrome.
If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I am <unk> offering a solution.
It says that we should judge <unk> people not in the color of their skin, but in the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, the idea looks really good."
But in practice, how do you do that?
How do you judge people based on the contents of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be involved in this for human rights to people, because I have to admit that I know some <unk> <unk> that they probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some of the <unk> that I know can make more choices and intelligent people on their sexual relations than I know.
So how do you put the subject of the content of <unk>
It turns out very hard.
And one part of me asks what if the character of a person could in the future being measured with an instrument, maybe <unk>
We really want to get at that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is it seems to be very important that the United States will continue to drive this current thinking of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is <unk> to be <unk> unless they're willing to be <unk> in which case it allows you to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context as a surgeon who has been talking about a couple of years ago that I'd done a couple of years ago that he had done to give birth <unk> and then pick them up, and so they turned their <unk>
But when the phone asked her the <unk> of the operation -- I was a very <unk> operation, and he told me that in that other country these kids would be very excited, and therefore I had to do it.
What I said, "Well, he's considered political <unk> rather than <unk>
The United States provides huge possibilities to people to be who they are <unk> to change the good end of the state.
So I think we have to be on your head.
Well, to conclude, I just want to say I've been speaking a lot of the <unk>
And I want to think about how democracy would be like democracy, or as it might have been, if we were given increased participation to <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit of a radical <unk> and I think there can be different ideas coming from different <unk> <unk> particularly if there are people thinking about groups.
For years ago, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in doing sexual difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in is the differences between men and women in the way we think and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women on average, -- on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to deal with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
I was when I was in graduate school, one of my <unk> I knew I was interested in feminism <unk> I considered <unk> as a <unk> as a <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what about feminine <unk>
And I thought, "It's the dumbest question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking the stereotypes of gender, so there's nothing in the <unk>
But the more I've been thinking about your question, the more it has a little bit of female in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something on average, on average, something different between the female and the male that makes us more susceptible to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So while the parents were very close to find the way to protect people by the state, we may be that we might have gotten more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched ourselves, the concept of protection with <unk>
And so maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we look at democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect, let's think about what we do each other for each other.
Thank you.
In the year 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to go to live and work, have the ability to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, at this moment we're far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't have a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they are worth much more than the cost of construction.
So we could easily isolate the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But we just put it out of the apartments.
Imagine the half of those people who wanted to live in the apartments are already owners and that the other half is still not to do it.
You could try to increase the ability to make it <unk> in all existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the <unk> <unk>
So it would be very hard to do all those <unk>
But they could go to a totally new place, and build a whole apartment building, and again, and when the standards of that <unk> <unk> construction instead of putting it into <unk>
So I suggested that the government will put new big reform zones to contain cities and gave them a name: cities under <unk>
I later found that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of Honduras.
Did you know that every year around 75,000 <unk> were coming out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> happened by a constitutional <unk> crisis.
Over the next <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform in which <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing for a TED talk.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a whole bunch of evidence on users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to its most essential.
The first point was the importance of the norms, like those rules that say you can't go and pick all the current residents of apartments.
<unk> a lot of attention to new technologies, but you need so much of technologies like rules for <unk> and usually the rules that prevent us <unk>
On the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent to <unk> a link with the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They told me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities are, much more valuable than their cost.
And I used this image that shows the value of land in a place like New York City, which in some cases, worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract argument and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms, which a city under <unk> is a place where you start with a <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules that <unk> there and a choice for people to choose if they want to go or not to live under those standards.
So the president of <unk> called me and told me that we had to do this project, this could be the way that our country's <unk>
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk about four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a photo of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Just this airport covers over 100 kilometers a square.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that is about 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
Everybody <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you so much for her talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have this in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this <unk> that a new city can provide new options for people.
There would be a choice of a city that could go out that could be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away to the North.
And also providing new options for leaders.
Because the U.S. government leaders would need help from <unk> countries could benefit from the countries associated with the countries that help them to establish and make the rules of <unk> so that they can all trust that the <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and saw one place.
This picture is from there.
It could take a thousand square miles.
And shortly after, the 19 of January, <unk> in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that allowed to create these special regions of development.
In a country that had just gone through this <unk> crisis the vote in Congress for this constitutional constitutional was <unk> to one.
All of the foundations are all in society in society, <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> it has to pass twice in Congress.
On December 17, it passed again in another voting voting for one.
Immediately after the <unk> of 21 by February of February, a <unk> delegation of about 30 <unk> went to the two places in the world that are most interested in engaging in the building of cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new big center of the city that is building in Korea -- it's bigger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years after they spent four years getting the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China and are preparing for a third.
And if you think about this practical, this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and they're thinking about a site for the second city.
They're setting up a legal system that would allow the <unk> administrators and allow them to operate under an external legal system.
A country has been committed to allowing his Supreme Court to be the ultimate <unk> of this new <unk> system.
There are urban and builders of cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that they've already solved is they have a good number of residents.
There are a lot of companies that would like to operate in <unk> especially in a place with a <unk> zone and there's a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change it immediately somewhere else.
There's a million dollars a year from Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family back to their family to get a job, sometimes they have to earn money for just eating or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even kids who are trying to meet with their parents who have not seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all around the world?
What do you think about <unk> so that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> I was asked to say, "Thank you.
I'm <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside the inside, I'm going to do a public confession and is that I live obsessed with the <unk>
I love to find, and more recently, to photograph and post my blog <unk> and colorful and different for every time.
But I didn't buy anything new.
All my clothes is from the second hand of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Oh, thank you.
The second second hand allows me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment, and in my <unk>
I go to know people who are passionate about my money goes to a good <unk> My point is <unk> and buy it becomes my personal search for <unk>
So what am I going to find today?
Being from my size?
I love color myself.
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all of the answers are positive, then I feel that I've won.
To go back to the theme of my stay, I want to tell you what I <unk> for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what do you have somebody who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I <unk>
I've brought seven pairs of inner <unk> and nothing else.
<unk> inside that one week is all I've put in my <unk>
I imagined that it would be able to find everything else I want to use after arriving here to Palm <unk>
And since you don't know how the woman you walk on to TED in <unk>  that means I found some things.
And I would like to show you the <unk> now for this week.
It doesn't sound that interesting?
While I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure to use new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this tiger <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always see phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All the globe, including <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, you don't just love you, too.
<unk> <unk> of the child that you're wearing in.
Sometimes people tell me that it looks like I play the <unk> or I would remind you about their <unk>
I like <unk> and saying, <unk>
<unk> <unk>
If you think you look good with something, it's almost certain you are.
And if you think you don't look good with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the age of 30 years I really understood the meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner world, and the outside, you don't see you can't look at it.
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth six words for you: The gold <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style and unique <unk> is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tested it over and again when people approached this week just by what I was wearing.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, Brooklyn, I'm going to give it all.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave certain things.
I don't need to love these things, because around the corner, there will always be a crazy suit of me, <unk> and bright <unk> if there is a little bit of love in my heart and he looks at.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a depiction of your brain that we can split in two parts.
The left side, which is the logic and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For instance, this would be somebody who is completely logical.
This would be someone who is totally intuitive.
So where do you look at your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> on one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something that -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that it's mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just like most of the other quantum physical physicists we need a lot of logic to amplify these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put together with them and then we see how <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As a intuition that you may have developed with the next year is the one that says one thing can be only in a place at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> the <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing on a parking bar.
It was a small child, and I didn't do it very well, they always <unk>
But I bet you play with that bar of parking lot taught a valuable lesson, and that is that the big things don't allow the <unk> to stay in a place.
This is a big model of conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you are a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with <unk> bars, play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all sorts of really weird things -- as they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point was the physics of a few years ago, you needed quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need it to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit in my logical side.
Because if everything is made out of small particles and all the small particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, so it shouldn't be all going on the principles of mechanical <unk>
I don't find the reason why he didn't have to.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object remains the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see that has been on an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's right in the center.
And then here we make a very large approach to the small metal <unk>
What we see is a small little piece of metal with a springboard and <unk> and <unk> on a platform.
And so I did this almost like the same way you would show a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a <unk> chip and I put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to do this nostril which is a kind of swimming <unk> that finds under the device.
This device has the ability to be in an extreme <unk> but for it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird things, but then when other people come up to leave you with doing those things, because I don't want it to <unk> or, really, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The fellow trip of inanimate objects are not just people, it's also the light that <unk> and wind from the room, and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we'd have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights and then they'll take a mat and pulled all the air, and then we stretched it to a temperature of less than a degree on top zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act as well.
So we measured their movements.
We found that it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, it was vibrating. and the way it <unk> was like a breath in this way, like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And to give it a <unk> <unk> we could make it <unk> and not just limit at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing, and it wouldn't react at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In a case, all of the trillions of atoms that make up that metal piece are still still and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down to the bottom.
It's only in certain <unk> when those <unk>
In the rest of the time you're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Really.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all of those years, because, look at this, the difference on scale between a single atom and that little metal is roughly the same as the difference between that little metal and you.
So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that metal piece can be in two different places, why don't you <unk>
I mean, it's my part of the logic I'm talking about.
So imagine if you were in a number of places at the same time. What would that be?
How do you act in your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we <unk> it and we turn the lights and look inside the box, we saw that the metal was there in a single piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects in the elevator are actually just quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics is going to think everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not that truth.
It's more than that, it's deeper.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the profound estimate of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another work on Google, until I launched the idea of doing something about museums and art to my boss that is here and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months to me.
Many negotiations and stories, I would care about it with 17 very interesting museums to nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story explains just in this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
And so when I started traveling and go into museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, trying to actually make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
You'd better look at the demo to then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've taken from their launch.
So, let's go ahead and let's <unk>
Look around all the museums there.
There's the gallery here, the MoMA, the <unk> the <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorites, by <unk> the art of New York City.
There are two ways to do it very simply.
We click and <unk> we are inside the museum.
No matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and <unk>
Do you want to navigate for <unk>
We open the flat plane, and with one click click on it.
They're inside, you want to go to the end of the table.
follow ahead and go forward.
<unk>
Thank you, but I've not come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in <unk>
I see the <unk> show.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's the whole data of <unk>
For those of you who are truly interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million pixels.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get about 10,000 million <unk>
So I'll show you what you actually do with 10,000 million pixels.
You can zoom in zooming around in a very simple way.
You see some fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to <unk>
So I started to play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "Hang on, this seems to be <unk>
I walked up and found that the kids were actually playing something.
And I spoke a little bit, I spoke to some people from the <unk> and I actually found that this is a game called <unk> which is about hitting a <unk> with a stick on a Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get deeper and deeper and see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to pull the image, so you can really see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're going to go back again at MoMA, in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, "The <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how you're supposed to actually create this <unk> play.
It goes up and actually <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is the <unk>
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are lots of things here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool part -- it's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can go online to create your own museum, create its own collection of all these images.
It's very easy -- we walk -- I've created this kind of function that I call "The power of <unk> -- we've just got a zooming around.
It's about "The <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things to yourself, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel when you look at these <unk>
So in conclusion, I think to me, the main thing is that all amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my mind, even also not come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that has been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital makes justice to its artwork and that is represented properly online.
And the great question I'm doing today is, "You have this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
You think it's a <unk>
In our lab, we call it sensitive design.
Let me tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I am from <unk> <unk> all the children in Italy grow up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I'm showing you this is that has happened something really interesting in <unk> careers -- one in the last two decades.
Every time ago, if you wanted to win an <unk> race one, take a budget and get it to a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you earned the race.
This is what in engineering, you have control control in real time.
This is essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
The interesting thing today is that real-time control systems are beginning to enter our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're going back to the air computers.
And as <unk> are starting to respond in a different way, and they can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is big.
As a note, I just wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the Earth's cortex but they represent 50 percent of the population <unk>
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are getting into our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> at MoMA, during the summer of the summer.
It's called <unk> Uncle <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, they start <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all of the existing atoms get sensors and <unk>
And that's changing the interaction that we humans have with the outside environment.
It's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> he says that at the end he took the hammer and threw it onto the Moses -- you can actually see a little bit of a <unk> <unk> and he said he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- which doesn't <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a little bit of <unk> <unk> in the idea of getting the environment and you break something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four and a half years in Italy.
It was a summer with some of 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup World
Maybe some of you remember the remember, they played Italy and France, and at the end, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at the activity happening in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the Athabasca River.
It's the morning, before the game.
The line is at the top.
At night early there are people over here, and there is <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people make a quick call on the toilet.
Second time, End of time.
First time <unk> a second.
<unk> and in a moment, the <unk>
<unk> Italy, yeah!
That night they all went to the center.
You see the great peak.
The next day everybody went to the center of the winning team and the prime minister in the time.
And then everybody <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, at the time, people go to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how the pulse of the city is that we would not have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> aren't about people, but of things we use and consume it.
Today, we know everything about the source of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, -- how do you <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project we developed some small tags to track the trash in their own system.
We started with a couple of volunteers that helped us in Seattle a little more than a year, label what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things like <unk>
And then we put a little chip, one <unk> and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
This is from <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that were not there.
They're happening complicated things, and there's a lot of transportation <unk>
But the other thing that we believe is that if you look at every day that the cup that we <unk> is not just somewhere on the planet.
And if the plastic bottle we <unk> a day still stays there.
So if we show that to people, then we can promote some change of <unk>
That was the reason of the project.
My colleague of MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detection and a lot of other cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is it <unk>
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all began with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and South Europe has a beautiful tradition of water use in public spaces in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop was, imagine that you have a <unk> and you add <unk> valves that open and <unk>
It was believed as a curtain of water, with water <unk>
If you go to the pixels you can write on them, show patterns, images, audio.
And when we zoom in, the curtain will open up so that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We introduced this to the mayor of <unk>
He liked a lot.
And then we had a commission to design the building on the entrance to the entrance to the <unk>
We call it <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There is no windows or no windows, but when you approach it opens up so you can happen.
The ceiling is also covered with water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all of architecture remains like in this case.
Those days always be somebody in the winter, when the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it goes down almost every architecture goes away.
So here is working.
You see the people who are going on inside.
And here I'm just trying to do it not <unk> when the sensors open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened tonight when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was even more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building, because the way they interact that had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open up to leave you, but a building that was still making <unk> and holes in the water and one had to jump out of <unk>
<unk> noise) And for us that was really interesting because we as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about the use that people will give up our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact with people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels the water and the <unk> and the projections of them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine that you could have little helicopters in the air, and each one of you had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like that we saw before, which is moving with others in synchrony.
Could we form this cloud, right?
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, where it changes is light, not the position position.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears in different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then all of that could make a cloud of pixels to the one that you can reach out and look at it and see from very diverse <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine every one of them controlled by a person.
We can have each pixel with a entry that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> from the best dance dancers of today, the star of New York and <unk> <unk> to capture their online movements and use them as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> <unk>
It's so <unk> 3D <unk> like motion capture.
It can <unk> all the movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels and we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as an input for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called <unk>
And the idea is, to imagine again, that we could involve people to do something and change our environment and change our <unk> environment, like a <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
So imagine that we could do that all <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we go from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign is <unk> we can move from the digital world from the <unk> power of networks, to physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would be built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions -- how to happen from the digital world into the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people deserve to do this together, in a collective way.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the actual cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, as in our cloud are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered with the pixel
You can move through the inside, having different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, to serve the main moments of the United Nations <unk> <unk> and even more, and it can be used as a connection to the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up, as a new <unk>
You can get into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better about what they are?
Suppose I would tell you that, with only some changes in your genes, you could improve the <unk> for more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you might like to be in a better way, be stronger to have more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and <unk>
What about doing more with good health?
Or maybe those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What is the most <unk>
What do you want to choose something?
<unk> of the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people do we choose creativity?
Raise your hand.
<unk> would probably be the number of creative creative people.
That's very good.
How many <unk>
A few more.
And the <unk> state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most people. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something that the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a prominent topic here at the TED Conference.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> which is in addition to <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> wrote an essay in biology makes sense except for the light of <unk>
But if effectively embrace the biological evolution consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
It's about others or to us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at one end, it is, of course, the more interest us.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There have been maybe 20 -- 25 different species of <unk>
Some of them have been and <unk>
We've been here about <unk> years old.
It might seem like we're very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the most basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat the <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it's the same protein, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And by talking about bacteria -- they realize that we all carry on the more bacteria that the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> asked you about the <unk> you think about the <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's warm dark water, it's very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that they can want without any <unk>
It really looks like a quick pathway for the bacteria with the occasional casual disruption in some <unk> <unk> towards the end.
But by the other hand, we are a wonderful thing for those bacteria in the same way that they're essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what did the future?
We're in a sort of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or to become something different, something maybe better adapted to <unk>
In this vast <unk> <unk> of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, like only one and unique <unk> and human life, a small note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you've got it done.
When I first <unk> college, I had my first class of biology.
I was fascinated by <unk> and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and realizing something fundamental in most of the existence of life, in <unk> organisms every cell <unk> and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted by two two cells.
But when the organisms come up, things start to change.
It goes into the sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the body death goes into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to believe that when I was a college student, I was thinking, well, I'd been killed death by <unk> it seemed quite reasonable at that time, but with every year I was going on, every time he had more <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas -- in <unk> in their 90s.
And one night he hits his front door.
He opens the door.
In front of him, you find a gorgeous <unk> of clothes.
And he looks at it, and he says, <unk> you look for a <unk> <unk>
He says, "Oh, George, I chose <unk>
And I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different target to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> only different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted you to stay healthy.
I wanted to restore health in disease.
I wanted it to live more and healthier.
Evolution is going through the genome to the next <unk> it will adapt and generation after generation.
From an evolutionary view, you and I are kind of <unk> <unk> designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then we'll let us fall to the sea.
I think everybody would <unk> the feeling that they put Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to get immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> you not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily contribute to longevity.
They don't necessarily serve the largest or the stronger or the more quickly and even more clever.
Evolution favors the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only killer survival test.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the <unk> bacteria, which can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there, fish <unk> fish into the <unk> and yet they've managed to make that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if you come back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution and, in particular, if you look forward, at phase <unk> I would say there's a lot of possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we have known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and volcanic <unk>
And secondly, as a species, we've made our environment to be adapted to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and <unk> us so much that it's no longer possible to have the isolation necessary to think about evolution.
A second possibility is that you create an evolution of traditional <unk> natural kind of <unk> of nature.
And the argument here is, that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as the <unk> as the species -- the distant planets are going to have the isolation and environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there's a third possibility for a sexy and intriguing possibility.
The <unk> I call it the new evolution, which is not just <unk> but <unk> and elected to us as individuals in the choices they <unk>
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
We first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society but it's what you choose and the individual and family level.
Think about it as if it could be able to choose not only sex in your <unk> but in its own body to make genetic <unk> to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or <unk> risk or <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in your genes.
If we look at the future, that kind of change is going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990, and she was 13.
<unk> billion dollars.
When I was finished, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a whole sequence of three billion base pairs of the human genome -- at a near time cost at 20,000 and in a week.
Not a lot to make the human genome actually to make the human genome for <unk> and being more and more at the end of all.
These changes come from.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect themselves but they're going to be <unk>
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in course with the vaccine against flu <unk> into cells of a <unk> plant.
Can you imagine a good thing that comes out of the <unk>
That's reality today and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine only another two <unk>
They can change the cells of their bodies but if they could change the cells of their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the newborn <unk> and give their children a better chance of a more healthy life, eliminate diabetes, eliminate diabetes, to eliminate the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want children more <unk>
And then that same <unk> technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases is going to allow us also to take care of <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could <unk> with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why not have a <unk> muscle muscle than allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't we live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions to pass this next generation and we can adopt the attributes we wanted to have turned the evolution of before in <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100 thousand years and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren are going to have to <unk>
We're going to use these choices in order for a better society, more successful <unk>
Or, we're going to choose selectively different attributes that we want for some of us but not for others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more ambitious and more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And most profound of all, we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom needed to take these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what I could <unk> these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you're at 900 <unk> <unk>
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine an engine by doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a single seat -- I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to <unk>
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "There is no problem. You probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had already <unk> the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the airplane with the Hudson River.
<unk> that's not the road.
It <unk> the motors.
Imagine being on an airplane and <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three <unk> words have heard.
He said, <unk> for <unk>
I didn't have to talk more about the flight <unk>
I was able to see it in his eyes.
<unk> <unk>
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to make before to die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to come from, and I didn't do it, all the fences I wanted to <unk> all the experiences that I wanted to have and never <unk>
As I was thinking about it, I came up with a phrase, which is, <unk> <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to leave you anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is where I was looking at the bridge by George Washington, which was not for a lot -- I thought about, Wow, I really feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes, I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity as a place to my <unk>
And I'm sorry that <unk> in things that don't care about people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship to my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, like <unk> at that, I decided to remove the negative energy from my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I am no longer trying to get <unk> <unk> to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is kind of like your mind clock is <unk> <unk> <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be <unk> in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, wow, she's not afraid.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to myself, "I love my life.
And that sadness <unk> in one single thought, which is, just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children grow.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> as a kid.
And for me, that was the whole reason for the world.
At that point, I got to connect those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great parent.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good parent.
I was given a miracle, not to die that day.
And it gave me another gift, which was the possibility to look at the future and to live in something else.
You know, you are flying around today, the challenge you can see it on your airplane -- and please not be that -- but imagine, and how do you go from.
What is the thing that <unk> you still hope to do, because they think they're going to live <unk>
How does your relationships change and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're being the best parents to <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many <unk> projects.
But the most great thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the '80s.
One day he came to her house after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today you have a total <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
His job influenced me.
I have a design of design and animation so that, obviously, graffiti is something that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
And so we decided we were going to take <unk> <unk> and to their cause.
So I went and met with his brother and father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are they going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "Just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second is not that I <unk> seen Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you are someone important and having a very good insurance -- you can't actually do it.
These devices are not accessible to people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Does anybody see the movie "The <unk> and <unk>
They communicate with that way, you go with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I presented to you with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead of that signed a check that didn't have the least idea of how I was going to <unk>
I slept with his brother and her father right there at the very moment, and so on that very moment, "OK, this is the <unk> Tony is going to talk, and we're going to find a way to turn it back to do its art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much on your inside there can't be <unk>
So I spoke at a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research <unk> who have a technology that allows you to project a light on any surface and then with a laser laser, draw on that and register the negative space.
So they go through making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle of life.
First you start with the sex organs then with the bad words, then with heart attacks, and at the end, people start to do art.
But there was always a life cycle in its <unk>
And so she started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of moving things from one side we had achieved a couple of things.
One, we touch the gates of safe companies, and we got a machine so that they could <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, is the most <unk> I call him <unk> because I'm going to talk to the guy with an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy's <unk>
The other thing that we did was bringing seven programmers all over the world by all over the corner of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved into the garage of the back and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought we were doing something totally stupid and that when they were <unk> would have taken away the frames of the walls and in their place would have <unk>
But for two weeks, I was born, and we went to the voyage of <unk> my son was part of my dog too, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a couple of <unk> <unk> that we bought in the voyage of <unk> Beach, some of copper wire and stuff from <unk> <unk> and Radio <unk>
We take a camera <unk> the <unk> we put it on a light light, and there's now a device that is free -- and it's building one <unk> we publish the source code, the software is going down in the <unk>
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company.
There is no hospital I can say <unk>
Any person with <unk> today has access to draw and communicate using just your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after a year of planning, two weeks of science work at night, Tony <unk> drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of your life and is looking across the support system.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a slide projector on a wall outside of the hospital.
And he came back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends and you can imagine what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was we had to bust in the parking lot, so we feel like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this, he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time I draw in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water, and somebody finally came to <unk> and get me back to me from there so I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a certain way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a great device but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to deal and make it faster and robust.
So since we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are doing money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then the Time magazine recognized us as one of the top 50 inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends of close the <unk> is that in April of this year, in the <unk> of Los Angeles in downtown Los Angeles is going to be an exhibit called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> it's going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them will be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you look at something that's not possible, do it possible.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- scenario, the computer, the microphone, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a certain time.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with a speech technology, I just recognized something and excited to me with wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you all to do every day when we find something that we feel like to do, if it's not now, <unk> And if I'm not me.
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in situations that are generally very difficult and at the same time as dangerous as well.
I went to <unk> difficult.
I worked on a <unk> <unk> mine.
<unk> in <unk> and dangerous areas.
And I spent 30 days of eating only this fun thing -- something hard in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career I've been trained in situations in particular situations with the only goal to trying to look at social questions in ways that we create <unk> and hopefully analyzing them in a way that you can see and accessible and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that I was coming here to do a TEDTalk about the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little differently.
So some of you may have heard it, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took an <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered the rights to the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What was the following: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you don't have the idea of what it is about and the content I could focus on the face, especially if I put it into ridicule or your company to do it.
But that said, it's a very good <unk>
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew somebody was going to buy the rights <unk>
If you would have asked me a year ago, I had never been able to <unk> with certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, examined the world marketing is.
And as I said earlier, I've been involved in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be <unk> I could do it for something so difficult or dangerous to enter the room with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a film.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that I'm treating the <unk> of products, and marketing and advertising, and that the whole film <unk> with <unk> and marketing and <unk>
The movie is going to call "The largest <unk> ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest film ever <unk> is that all of the top at the bottom, from beginning to end, it has pictures of <unk> all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title was the <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> in the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea, <unk> <unk> is <unk> That's what? <unk> It's <unk> A <unk>
I'm a <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the X marks in the title, but we're going to make sure that <unk> all categories that we could in the film.
Maybe we had a shoe and it gets into the most cool shoe that you've ever met.
The most cool car you've ever driven in "The largest <unk> ever <unk> the best <unk> you have <unk> <unk> of "The largest <unk> ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing you the brands as part of life, make them <unk> the <unk> -- MS: And actually we showed the whole process of how it works.
And the goal of film film is transparency.
You're going to see all the process in this film.
That's the whole idea, all the movie <unk>
And I would love to help us help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's funny because it's the first time I hear that's the most respect for the audience.
And yet, I don't know how <unk> is going to be the people at that.
<unk> You have a <unk> I don't know if you're <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> <unk> How much money does it need to do to do this?
MS: A million and a half a half, <unk> <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard to the meeting with them, but it's certainly going to be worth of trying to convince a couple of big elements.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that movie comes out to us to see us as a whole bunch of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be <unk>
MS: But it will be hard to <unk> the film or to be I?
JK: Both things.
MS: It means you're not very optimistic.
So I get <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> Awesome. Awesome.
MK: We have to think about which <unk>
MS: Yeah.
MK: We have some places where I'm going to go, <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: I thought we <unk> the <unk> meant we have a conversation outside the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one of these companies suddenly disappeared.
No one wanted anything to do with this film.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, was to introduce the product to as many people as possible, so that so many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of separate media, is not the idea to tell you with that new <unk> vehicle that will lead the message to the <unk>
No, that was what I thought.
But the problem was, you can see that my idea had an error <unk> and that mistake was this.
Actually no, there was no mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what it represents this image.
See, when you search for images of <unk> in Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that showed up.
I like your <unk> <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> free <unk> or <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in <unk> practices being the last line probably the biggest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president of <unk> even the CEOs of <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to make it really much changes.
But why? Well, transparency <unk> --  -- like that weird bear that still follows <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird inner path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want you to <unk> <unk> story.
We want you to take a story, but we want <unk> <unk>
See, when I was a kid, and my father would tell me in some lie -- and there's him staring at me, as I used to say, "Son, there's three sides in every story.
It's your story, it's my story, and it's the <unk> story.
As you see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with just a company, a agency, wanting to help me -- and that's because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go through my own, I would have to take away from the <unk> and go to the business and go to the business and go to the business I myself with my whole team.
So what I started to see from suddenly -- and that I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking to the companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends that make big, enormous, giants and others that make small, independent films like mine.
And my friends who make films of big, giant films, they say the reason their movies have so much success because of the brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the movie is called "The largest <unk> ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time for an interview with someone I can tell you are fine for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little anxious.
I want you to help you <unk>
Maybe you should have a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there it gives you one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> from <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as to <unk> solid, to <unk> on it like that.
That's the big <unk>
Now I can answer your questions and give you a <unk>
Karen Frank: Are we a little brand.
<unk> to the kind of little movies that we're going to do, we're a little bit more <unk>
So we don't have the budget that have other brands.
So doing things like this, you know, remind people the reason that this is interested.
MS: What are the words used to describe to <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a great question.
<unk>
MS: <unk> is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something new <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this kind of <unk> versus <unk> the smell and the <unk>
It keeps you.
How do we keep it cool more time? With better <unk> more <unk> three times more <unk>
Things like those who <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a <unk>
I need to talk to the man from the street, to people like me, to the <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: I got my <unk>
I don't know.
I like <unk>
Woman: By the 1980s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what's the <unk> brand.
<unk> <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of the dark color, lots of gray and things like that.
Usually I'm wearing them like sunglasses, or <unk> or the <unk>
Woman: If you were a brand, I could be an <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman #2: Some of it <unk> partly <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
<unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is <unk> because <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we don't all have a result, but I would often focus on the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could go into my head, somebody who could help me understand what the <unk> of <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that <unk> personality.
If they were able to do that, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a familiar picture.
A: Tell a little bit of how it relates to your thoughts and feelings of self.
MS: These are doing the way my way to see the world.
A: Tell us from that world.
MS: Now that world? I think your world is the world that we perceive as people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live life, the work you do.
All of those things come up and start in a place and you start in my case, and they start in my family in Virginia Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk?
MS: The next one is "This was the best day of my life."
A: how does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's kind of who I want to be.
I like different things.
I like the weird things, I like weird things.
A: Tell me about <unk> what does that do that?
What's the <unk> In which phase phase you find right now?
Why is it important? What is <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little more than you are not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to fear what kind of rollercoaster <unk> are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you. No, thank you.
A: thank you for your patience, <unk> Big <unk> Yes.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come out of this.
I had a lot of crazy things about this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> in your personality of <unk> the <unk> Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They got very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies are just becoming <unk> in one of their strong points or in the other instead of focusing on both.
Many companies tend to -- and it's the <unk> nature of avoiding the things that are not <unk> to avoid the fear, those items, and you actually come back and make something positive to you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands look like this?
The first here is classic <unk>
And you can also see here at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> marks and <unk> those things that have gone and come from, but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS: <unk> <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asks you to take your <unk> your <unk> your <unk> what would be?
You're a <unk> <unk> You're somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or are you a lot of a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful to be pretty cool as the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or mystical as <unk>
Or are you more <unk>
You're conscious, sophisticated as <unk>
You're a <unk> traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> you <unk>
You're reliable stable, familiar, <unk> <unk> <unk> or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mostly because they wouldn't have control, they would have no control over the final product.
We allowed us to tell the story of <unk> and we came to tell the story in this movie of how now the MRI is using MRI to identify the <unk> centers in the brain both for commercial marketing as for film.
We went to San Paulo where they have banned advertising at the open.
Throughout the city for the last five years, there's no <unk> there's no <unk> there's no <unk>
And we went to school districts where companies are getting their way into the schools in the U.S. problems.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects I've had the biggest answer or the ones that I've had more success is those in which I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these <unk> did.
They went to the <unk> they took the <unk> and they said, maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how have he gone? They went <unk>
Well, since the film was released in the <unk> <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers only a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> and <unk> and TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online, it's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has started winning momentum.
And it's not bad, because almost every donor agencies that we talked to you with their customers not <unk>
I've always believed that if you take risks, if you take risks, that in those risks are opportunities.
I think when you take the people out of that is pushing us to fail.
I think that when you train your employees in loss of risk is preparing all their company for <unk>
I feel that what's going to happen to move forward is that we need to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people that they are not afraid of the opportunities they can <unk>
Ultimately, let's move forward, I think we need to give it to fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear <unk>
From one <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to support transparency.
Today, more than ever a bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said that, with honesty and transparency, all my <unk> <unk> has been presented by my good friends from <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> huge data in great opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So, <unk> on the name of transparency, that happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check to the name of the TED Lab, the <unk> Foundation for <unk> to be applied to my care for TED next year.
The idea behind the <unk> <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Its biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are real-time control systems.
If we managed to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with the <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software -- are a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put a cash virus cash into a portable computer for an engineer to set this gray, so then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a digital <unk>
The <unk> enter the gray box, <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, yeah?
I want to tell you how we discover this.
When we started researching about <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of <unk> the <unk> using multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> <unk> these control systems.
That struck us the attention, and we started an experiment where we <unk> our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened with this.
So they were very strange.
<unk> <unk> as a <unk> lab that he didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And after experiment with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
<unk> is looking for actively in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program is trying to infect it's actually working on that <unk>
It doesn't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working in this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It could be, let's say for example, a U.S. energy plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than <unk> the goal soon.
And so we pulled the code, and we discovered that I was <unk> in two <unk> bombs -- a small and a big one.
We also saw that there were very <unk> people that obviously had all of the internal information.
<unk> all the dots I attack.
You probably even know how much it <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that the <unk> of <unk> is complex, and high technology, let me tell you, the payload is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code.
We are talking about about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks like old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking at at first were called calls of the system, because we know what they do.
And then we were looking at <unk> and we were trying to engage them with the real world, with potential real-world goals.
We need <unk> theories that we can pass on or <unk>
To get to theories about goals -- we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a mass valuable, and it's probably been in Iran, because that's where most infections have been <unk>
You don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all experts in <unk> and energy plants between our <unk>
I called them in an effort for <unk> their experience with what we find in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with control of the <unk>
There's this part of that room inside the <unk> that black object that you see.
If you run the speed of this <unk> they can certainly <unk> and even make the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and confuse it in an obvious effort to go back to the nest <unk> so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
And we're trying to figure out the big digital <unk> looking at very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> number is shown in that code, you can't <unk> it.
I started researching scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they are <unk> in what's called a <unk> and each <unk> contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
A <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had to do with hands.
So it wasn't like that.
The results have been coming up with several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> and we had to start again.
Still, we found that both digital <unk> were waiting for only and itself, but from different perspectives.
The little <unk> is taking a <unk> and making <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicate with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what is the <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry about other targets being <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some really interesting things that we saw -- I really <unk>
This is the gray, gray, and you see the <unk>
What this thing does is <unk> the <unk> of the sensors for example, of the pressure sensors and the dopamine sensors and provides code, which is still running during the attack, with fake <unk> data.
And believe it or not, these fake data data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the safety of security is fed up with <unk>
It's great <unk>
So the idea here obviously not just <unk> the operators in the fourth of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not get fast.
For example, in an energy plant, when the large steam turbine goes off, you have to open the valves of escape into a <unk>
Obviously, this cannot make a human operator either.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then you can get bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And neither the <unk> or the security system <unk>
That <unk>
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
There's nothing to see, specifically with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work too, for example, in an energy plant, or in a car factory.
It's <unk>
And you don't have a <unk> <unk> that will disseminate this payload with a <unk> key as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology for <unk>
<unk> as possible.
And if you made that, with what we <unk> is with a mass of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are <unk>
We must face the implications, and better that we start preparing now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has done public in many sides than people assumed that <unk> is the main facility behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> OK, you really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the superpower superpower behind this.
There's one thing, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in a way, our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thanks for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can take you and give them <unk> or another one that makes users of coffee chairs come up and come back again.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
It's nothing different from something that you put in the morning, gives you a great force, which is also increasing its speed, and aid, for example, to handle balance.
It's actually the true integration of the man and the machine.
But not only that -- you can integrate it and connect with the universe and with other things.
This is not an <unk> idea.
To show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, has to take on their back a 45 pounds, and it's <unk> to take even more equipment.
And obviously this leads to some major complications -- lesions in the back, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with <unk> damage.
We decided to look at this challenge, and create a exoskeleton that could help manage the issue.
Let me introduce you to <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> <unk>
Soldiers: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can take you 90 pounds per <unk> over a lot of hours.
Their flexible design allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and running <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my <unk>
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial <unk> to produce this device -- this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's go back and go back to the users of the wheels, on what I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people around the world around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens very often, and young people with damage in the spine that when they start their life -- 20 or 40 years -- they collide with a wall and the wheelchair is going to be their only option.
We also talk about the population that are going to be multiplying as quickly.
His only option, a lot of times -- because of a brain injury or some complication -- is the <unk>
And this has been this for the last 500 years, from its successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start to write a new chapter about mobility.
So let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was 19 years ago in the neocortical column, and as a result, couldn't go back for 19 years, until now.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has sensors ...
It's completely <unk> on the crutches that send signals to the computer on board, here on the back.
There are some batteries that give you the motors on the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it move on to this smooth and very natural path.
AB: I was 24 years at the top of my life when, for a <unk> jump in the air, during the bottom of it was <unk>
In a fraction of the second, I lost all of my feeling and all the <unk> movement.
Shortly after that, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> you never get to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole my way to the last slide of hope of self.
The amount of <unk> technology has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs down in <unk> climbing rocks and even riding <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: You can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the lives of future generations -- not just soldiers, but Amanda, and all of the users of chairs and everybody.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have the <unk> they practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious stuff.
And no, it's not the festival for <unk> or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet their cousins.
This is the world of the wild bonobos of the rainforests of Congo.
The bonobos are, along with the chimpanzees, their closest living lives.
That means we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary <unk> who lived about six million years ago.
Now, the chimps are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made too much emphasis on this aspect of our narratives of human evolution.
But bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by large, <unk> the Bonobo society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society, where lethal violence has not been <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the bush and it's been very difficult to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> an Earth of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario that has been sustained for decades and caused almost as many of the deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction will also be placed in danger of the Bonobo.
The colony of hunting meat and deforestation is that you can't fill in either a stadium with the bonobos that they stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure of it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos can be heard of laughter hidden by <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know it as the <unk> apes the love, not <unk> because they have <unk> sex -- <unk> and <unk> to handle conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than <unk>
<unk> like humans, they love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a game game.
For us and for them the game is fundamental to set up bonds and foster <unk>
With him we learn <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of <unk> organisms.
And when you look at the cochlear game, it looks at the root roots themselves, the dance and the <unk>
The game is the glue that connects us.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos of the wild.
First, it's a <unk> <unk> game, and I don't talk to football.
Here's a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, <unk> <unk> <unk>
I just think that in this case, he loves it, right?
Yeah.
So the sexual play is common both in bonobos as in humans.
And this video really is interesting because <unk> this video really is interesting because it shows the invention of bringing common elements into the game -- like <unk> and also how the game requires trust, and it <unk> <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt many ways, some of which are <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who is playing with fresh water.
I think that as her, sometimes we play ourselves, and we explored the limits of our inner worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the actual <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of the understanding that Bonobos give us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future in which we have to adapt to a more difficult world to more and more cooperation.
The secret is the key to these abilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes have to play.
But let's get to the peak our computer capacity.
The game is not <unk>
The game is critical.
For Bonobos and humans alike, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it seems at least appropriate to play, you can be the most urgent time.
So to fellow primates, to accept this gift of evolution and play together while <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization of a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> fires like a captain of captain in a <unk> body.
And in our city, where volunteers are in a highly skilled staff one has to get to the <unk> site very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a fairly high probability of going.
But still, there was a race against the other volunteers to get the captain in charge and find out what our work was.
When I found the <unk> he was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that I had certainly walked from one of the worst days of his life.
We were at full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in her pajamas and her house was on fire.
The other volunteer that had just gotten before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- came to the captain and he asked him to go back and save the dog owner.
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money who, during the rest of her life, I would have to tell the people that I walked into a building in a call to save a living, only because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
<unk> made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to get the home.
I need you to <unk> the fire, you get this woman a pair of shoes."
I promise that.
It wasn't exactly what I hoped but <unk> I got on the stairs, at the end of the hall went to the firemen that at that height or less or less finished to shut down the fire and went into the top room looking for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my load on the stair where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog on the front door.
<unk> out of the house -- the treasures for the house, where, as it was to wait, her treasure more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the apartment received a letter from the <unk> <unk> <unk> for the brave effort to save her home.
The kindness that she looked for on what else was someone had had a pair of shoes.
Both in my <unk> in Robin <unk> as in my calling as a volunteer <unk> witness acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also acts of grace and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who've been made, or they're doing remarkable levels of success, I'd like to remind you about this: I don't have it.
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, <unk> now.
<unk> food in a <unk> <unk> a neighborhood park.
are mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save the life of someone but every day we're going to be able to influence someone's life.
So they trained the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, it comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big <unk> of a mass block.
The first blocks of concrete made up in <unk> with a very simple idea -- modules in a fixed measure of a fixed measure that fit into each other.
Very quickly, these became the most widely used industry in the world.
They have allowed us to build things bigger than us, as buildings or bridges, a brick at a time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> we came up with this.
He called him brick <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> bricks came to every home.
It's estimated that over 400 billion or 75 thousand bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges or homes.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> just adopted the block of concrete, the <unk> in the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year in the labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small unit of plastic that would take us from a world of aesthetic <unk> stacked around each other to a world where it was all interactive.
Like the concrete block -- the transistor allows you to create much greater and more complex circuits a brick at a time.
But there is a <unk> difference, the transistor was just to experts.
I personally don't believe that the building blocks of our time are reserved for experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of bringing engineers from engineers to the hands of performers and designers.
A few years ago, I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, <unk> and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is they're joining <unk>
So you can't fit in a wrong way.
<unk> have a code of color.
The green is the <unk> the blue is the stream, the pink is the input and the orange color is <unk>
So you only have to assemble a blue with one green and very quickly and you can start to make the higher circuitry of it.
A blue with a green is producing light.
Can we put a button in the middle and we have a <unk>
If we change the button by a pole, which is here, and now we have a light light.
We put this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of taking it out, connecting and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using very simple <unk>
To make it faster or <unk> just <unk> this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a collection of growing.
We want all the interactions in the world to be <unk> to <unk>
<unk> sounds, solar panels, <unk> everything needs to be accessible.
We've given the kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light night, or why the <unk> door is keeping you open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also brought back to design schools.
So for example, designers without expertise in electronics start playing with <unk> as a material.
You can see, with bottles of paper and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk>  A few weeks ago, we took <unk> the designers at the Rhode Island School -- who have no expertise in engineering, just in wood and paper, and we said, Make something.
Here's an example of a project that have done, a <unk> <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which is afraid of darkness.
For these <unk> engineers, it became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to reach for everyone.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, you can download all of the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interactive world is ours.
So ahead and things.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my little company is seeking to get involved with the environment focused on the focus of the focus on the road.
It's distributed distributed collaboration.
This is a little clip of what we do.
<unk> Wait for a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> we can continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I get time at time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment which is actually <unk> everything that is supposed to be <unk> we asked them to work in the government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like <unk> to <unk>
<unk> some members every year, and we put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of going to the Third World to the <unk> we send them to the wild world <unk>
They did big <unk> they worked with <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of technology today.
<unk> <unk>
This is a hydrant in the city of Boston.
Here it appears as if I would find a quote, but what really looks for is that somebody will have been trapped by the snow, because he knows it's not very good when it is covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask for help for this <unk>
Last year in Boston had a team of <unk> members for <unk>
They were there in February and at that time, I took a lot last year.
They realized that the city never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else, that the citizens of <unk> with <unk> sidewalks right in front of them.
So it did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice app that you can take into a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case, he got <unk>
If you don't do it, somebody can <unk>
I mean, it has a <unk> component.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of 21 applications last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it spreads <unk>
One responsible for <unk> systems of <unk> to see this app that could be used, not for the snow, but for citizens to get <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> of tsunami, but people <unk> batteries.
So he asks citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizen <unk> the <unk>
And Chicago's just <unk> to get people to <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that we developed using it.
And this has been spread without <unk> in organic and primal.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you know this doesn't happen.
The software acquisition takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
And then they told us that that was made by normal channels there have taken at least two and a half million dollars.
And that's not nothing.
Now there is a project in the state of California that until the moment of 2,000 billion dollars and it doesn't work.
And there's projects like this in every level of government.
So an application that takes a couple days and it spreads in a viral form is a kind of shot shot from the government <unk>
It suggests the best way to work, not as in private companies, as many people think it should be.
It's not as a technological company, but rather like the Internet itself.
I mean, it <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution but as an collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out we're very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there's a very large community of people who are building the tools for us to deal with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to <unk> applications every day in their own communities.
You haven't given the government.
Do you feel a great frustration with that, but they didn't know about it.
And these people know something that we've lost in sight.
And this is that if we leave the feelings of politics, the line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that make us crazy to us, the government is, essentially, in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because alone <unk>
Now, a lot of people have <unk> government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
The politics don't <unk> the government itself.
And because the government ultimately <unk> -- remember that <unk> the <unk> the way it would think about it to affect the change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to make it <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is about everything about <unk>
This is the health care center of services and information.
It's the place that runs calls if you're a brand <unk> in the United States.
Scott <unk> this call.
He entered the base of official knowledge.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And then finally, he said, "Hey, can you open the gates in your house, make some strong music and see if it <unk>
And it worked. So for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has a <unk> web and mobile phone called <unk> <unk>
They didn't have that app.
It was the work of very clever people from the Office of New <unk> <unk>
One day, this really happens to this <unk> <unk> in my garbage <unk> I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do for <unk>
<unk> dynamics is different.
Scott was talking to you.
In <unk> <unk> it's all public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, it saw a neighbor.
The next report was saying, "I went up to the place, I found the garbage garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I went back to the <unk>
Good night, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the <unk> of digital and physical.
And it's also a great example of the government to the collaboration with distributed resilience.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of <unk>
I'm talking about a platform for people to become <unk> and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
I connected to two people.
And I could have connected with government services to be needed but neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper and cheaper than the government services.
When a neighbor helps each other, we will help the communities.
If we call blood control, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we have to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people hate it, but think you're the input of the other.
What our input is to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen a political leader -- sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government takes our values and fix our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the shallow layer of <unk>
That's why we call <unk>
And we say that word <unk>
But it's that <unk> what holds us that it belongs to us that we believe as something that we believe in our diet, that other thing, and in consequence we're losing the power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we'll have to make the bureaucracy that is sexy.
Because that's where the real work is happening.
We need to collaborate with the <unk>
That makes the <unk> movement.
Have you <unk>
This is a group of citizens concerned that have written a very detailed report of <unk> pages in response to the request of <unk> <unk> <unk> on the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's pure <unk>
And so that we have <unk> to the government, is time that we ask ourselves, what we want to leave to our children.
You have to see the enormous challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really believe that we will have to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of <unk>
We can't ask government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to root the function of government so that it can be expanded <unk> to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows it's not so hard to act <unk> we just have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members of age is 28 years old, so I am, I'm a bigger generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who's going to <unk> you're all going to talk.
They can express their opinions in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when you face the government problem with the government doesn't really care about making their voices.
They're using their hands.
They bring hands into the work to program for order to work better at the government.
And those applications allow us to use the hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> pulling out a garbage bucket that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we could always have cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people do.
But these applications are kind of like digital <unk> that we're not only <unk> we are not only consumers of government that we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that; we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until you don't get the <unk>
So I want to ask everybody, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all together, we will be a crowd, or we will be a swarm of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in our prisons and prisons and the death row.
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'm going to be here at TED watching and hearing these <unk> and it has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that tell you here have impact around the world.
At random if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have otherwise.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we have seen fantastic glasses.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if they teach them feeling, they can have special meaning in it.
A physician can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of the right, my job.
I learned from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional home of a family <unk> dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in all of us in the family.
She <unk> a lot of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born about the <unk> and his experience with slavery and <unk> the way I saw the world.
She was hard, but it was also <unk>
When I was little, and I looked up and looked up and gave me a good hug.
I was so hard that I barely could breathe and then get me down.
One or two hours later, I would go back to <unk> and I said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I said no, no, I was going to give me my back, and if I said yes, I had left peace.
I had this human quality that I would always wish to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was lower than 10.
Sometimes, when I was going to spend a while with it, it was no easy to take his time and your attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight -- nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
I thought it was a game.
And then he looked at him, and she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up and went through the room and she took me out of my hand, and she said, "Come on. We are both going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
And he took me out and said, "You know, I'll tell you something, but you can't tell me about it."
I said, "That's okay, <unk>
She said, "Now no, I didn't know. I said, "Sure."
And then I sat down, I looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you <unk>
I'll never forget it.
And then he said to me, "Only I want you to wake up three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to do, is you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
And then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to do, is that you will always be doing the right thing -- even though the right thing is it <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk>
And then finally, he said, "The third thing I want to think of, is that I never <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
I grew up in the field, in South school, I have a younger year and an older year of a younger year.
When I was 14 or 15, my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> grabbed my sister and me and went to the forest.
We are just doing the <unk> of the time.
He took a sip of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. You know, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, "You know, <unk> <unk> and you always make the same thing that we do.
I already took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me <unk>
And he said, "What is it?" Take a <unk>
He looked at me and he went down with strength and <unk> "Oh, I won't be thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all of the grandchildren who are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that I probably shouldn't say.
I know that will spread <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this is a <unk> I mean by the power of identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others who don't really see any sense.
We can't get them to do things that they don't think they can do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been imprisoned during the <unk>
My uncles died of diseases related to alcohol.
And these were the things that, according to it, we had to <unk>
Now, I'll try and talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different from what was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In the United States, we have the largest incarceration rates of the world.
We have seven million people on probation.
And this massive incarceration in my opinion, has changed fundamentally our world.
In poor communities, or black communities, they find so much <unk> so much sensations by these facts.
One of three black men between 18 and 30 years is in jail or in parole.
In urban <unk> all over the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore Washington, 50 to 60 percent of all young people in jail or in parole.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that is so much better if you're rich and guilty.
It's not <unk> but wealth affects the results.
And it seems like we felt very <unk>
The fear of fear and anger make us believe that these are not a problem with ours.
We're <unk>
It looks interesting.
We are looking at our work some of these very curious <unk>
In my state in Alabama, as well as in other states, you have a sudden <unk> for always if you have a criminal <unk>
Now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black male population has lost the right to vote.
And if we projected it to the next 10 years the level of quality loss will be as high as it was before they <unk> the law of the right to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my clients are very young.
America is the only country in the world where children are supposed to die in prison.
We have in this country in jail for children, no possibility of getting out there.
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
<unk> people in the death row.
This issue of death is interesting.
In a certain sense, you've convinced us to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way about how we're in our identity.
There is another form of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
Death penalty in America is defined by error.
From every nine <unk> people have identified one which is innocent that it's <unk> and released from the death row.
A <unk> <unk> a <unk> of every nine.
This is interesting.
You could never be able to fly airplanes if of every nine that you <unk> one would be <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students on <unk> history, I talk about slavery.
I'm talking about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding and that went to the Second World War.
We really don't know much about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was also defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The terror of terror was what defined their lives.
Now there are people older people who come up to me and say, "Mr. <unk> you teach, <unk> <unk> people who stop saying that in our own business story, for the first time with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. <unk> who grew up with that."
The age of terrorism was, obviously, with <unk> and decades of music and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time we love with each other.
We are constantly creating tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about <unk> I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they could not overcome race <unk> without a compromise and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done that.
I was in Germany leading about death.
It was fascinating because one of the professors stood up after my talk, and he said, "You know it's pretty disturbing to listen to what you <unk>
<unk> You don't have death row in Germany.
We can never be here."
The room stood in silence and a lady said, "There is no way for our history, we could never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we, <unk> and <unk> we would <unk>
<unk> about this.
How would we experience ourselves in a world where a nation like Germany, and they <unk> people, especially if they were in their most <unk>
We couldn't do it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these things as difficult, the positive and wonderful things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology. We need creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, abuse, abuse, the <unk>
In my view, you need to integrate both things.
Recently we talk about the need to have more hope, more dedication to the basic challenges of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> which you'll never get to TED.
And thinking about them is, in a way, something that's inside of us.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational as <unk> as <unk>
By innovation, with creativity. The development is not just about brain ideas.
These things come from ideas that are <unk> also by the convictions of the heart.
This connection of mind with heart is what drives us not just in the bright and <unk> but also in the dark and it is hard.
<unk> <unk> the great leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, suffering the <unk> we looked at all kinds of things, but mostly we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a willingness to be in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think is even in communities like TED, must <unk>
There's no disconnect related to technology and design that allowed us to truly be human if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> to injustice.
Now I want to suggest that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we define these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer to meet Rosa <unk>
These women got together simply to talk.
Occasionally, the Chinese lady called me to say, <unk> comes the lady <unk> We're going to get together to talk.
Do you want to come and <unk>
I said, "Yes, lady. I do."
And then she said, "Well, what are you going to do when I <unk>
I was <unk> <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Ms. Parks went to me and said, "Now, I <unk> tell me that this idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help the ones that have been <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in criminal justice administration.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom for children.
We try to do something about death <unk>
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave her all my best speech and at the end of the end, and he looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, Ms. <unk> got her my finger in the face and said, "It's why you have to be very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to figure out how to deal with those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because eventually humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been trained on simple stuff.
I've come to understand and believe that every one of us is higher to the worst that we have <unk>
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if somebody tells a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if somebody gets something that's not <unk> it's not to be a <unk>
Even if somebody kills each other, it's not a <unk>
So I think there is a basic dignity in people who should be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and, certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
That's right.
I really think that in many parts of the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that although it's very <unk> very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> we don't judge our technology, for our <unk> or for our intellectual ability or rational.
At the end of course, <unk> the character of a society, not by the way they treat the rich, powerful and <unk> but the way they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I make a lot of force.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a very important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been retrofitted with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to prison, and I see my <unk> clients and 14 years old, who have been <unk> so they would love them as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge become something that isn't it?
The judge is <unk> as an adult, but I see a kid.
A very late evening I was awake in God, if the judge can turn you into something you don't belong to you, must have <unk> powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magic powers.
You should ask some of that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a <unk> <unk> a small <unk> black.
I started working on <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> so my <unk> black customer was treated like a privileged <unk> a 75 year-old leader.
In the <unk> I made there have been <unk> behavior in the <unk> of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how this country doesn't exist, but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning I woke up thinking about that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really the <unk>
To my horror, not only <unk> but he had sent to court.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And then finally, my God, I have to go to the break through this case, stupid.
I got into the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I went into the court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I ended up on the car.
I was going up the stairs when I met a black man <unk> was the <unk> of the courthouse.
When I saw me, she came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he says, "That's you. I said yes.
So I walked up and moved me down.
And I stood up in the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
And that connected deeply with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into <unk>
When they arrived, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. <unk> you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk>
People started to get out.
I was the one I had written those <unk>
<unk> the policemen <unk> <unk> <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people -- all of the crazy because we were talking about races, because we were talking about poverty, because we were talking about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye, I hit the <unk> that was going and <unk>
And he would look out the window and <unk> at hear all that <unk>
Come on here and over here.
Finally, this old black black, with <unk> I walked into the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge <unk> a <unk>
During the break a <unk> <unk> he showed me, because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant <unk> over the old black black.
And he said, "You know, what do you do in the <unk> hall.
And the old black guy stood up, he looked at me, and he looked at me, and he looked at me, and he said, "We will take this young job to tell this young man who maintains her view in the goal of <unk>
I have come to TED because I think a lot of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very large, but it folds into justice.
That we cannot be truly human beings, if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is tied up to each other.
That our visions of technology, design entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of you who share this, I just want to tell you that you're going to keep your eyesight on the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Tell you to hear and see an obvious picture of the audience, in this community, to help in your way, to do something.
Something that's not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities nearby.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which one is going to be an effort to deal with the funds that are spent today in terms of punishment.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars worth of death, in the next five years, a billion dollars.
And in spite of this, the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> don't do anything.
Here's an opportunity for change.
This <unk> is going to come up with these funds to make the law screen to safety.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in the <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation is that it has to do with the largest rate of <unk>
What would you say to the <unk>
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> in violence has remained relatively stable.
The huge growth in <unk> in this country is not for crimes of violence.
It's for the wrong war against drugs.
That's why this rise is dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince us for the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people down to the supply chain, to steal a bicycle for small crimes against the property, rather than making these resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy on punishment is nothing for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: So you have <unk> you are excited about here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for coming to TED. Thank you.

Oh, my God.
Peter <unk> These are just some clips that I got in the last six months, <unk> could be the last six days or for the last six days.
The idea is that media media prefer <unk> negative news, because our minds pay attention to you.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of the day our senses are getting so much more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And as nothing matters to us more than survive, the first stop in all of this data is an old piece of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early detection, <unk> <unk>
<unk> and records all the information searching for something in the environment that could make us harm.
And so from a <unk> of stories that were looking at the bad ones.
That old saying of <unk> "If there are blood, <unk> is really true.
And because all of the digital devices give us the negative news, seven days a week, 24 hours a day, no wonder that we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world go wrong with worse.
But maybe it's not that way.
Maybe, in change, what happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps the enormous progress done in the last century by a series of forces is accelerating, so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, the extinction of species, water <unk> and <unk> we have no doubt of them.
As human beings, we are very good at <unk> the problems and, in the long end we just had them.
<unk> then what's happened in the last century to see where we go.
Over the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> per capita income per capita is <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has shrunk 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food, of transportation and communications, has dropped 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we are living the most peaceful time of human history.
Charles <unk> that global literacy is about 25 to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people have it.
And we continue to <unk> more and higher expectations.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in the U.S., much of the people who live under the line of poverty are electricity, water, <unk> TV, <unk> air conditioning and cars.
<unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> the <unk> on the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
<unk> a lot of this technology is technology, and about its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> the information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the price performance for about 12 to 24 months.
And so the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law over the last hundred years.
I want you to notice two things on this curve.
First of all, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad times, in the war and peace, in recession and <unk>
It's the kind of fast computers that we used to build faster computers.
It stops at any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in a law on the left, it's curve up.
The growth rate of technology is more and faster.
And in this curve, to <unk> of Moore's Law is a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
The computation in the cloud, that my friends in <unk> call endless computation, sensors and networks, the robotic printing and its ability to democratize and distribute personalized production across the planet, the synthetic biology, fuels and food, digital medicine and <unk> and <unk>
I mean, how many saw the victory in "Jeopardy" from Watson, in <unk>
It was <unk>
I was looking at the newspapers the best headline that I <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not a easy game.
It plays with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine that artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all of the mobile phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We taught these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for every single <unk> of the planet, it's about creating a life of the possible.
It's about taking that out of it, and make it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's an <unk> story in the <unk> 1800s.
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
<unk> soldiers ate with <unk> and the same <unk> covered with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal in the planet, it was much more than gold and <unk>
That's why the tip of the Washington <unk> in Washington, is aluminum.
You see, even though aluminum is the mass of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as a pure metal <unk>
It's tied up by oxygen and <unk>
But then it came to the <unk> and he made it as cheap as it was <unk>
<unk> this analogy to the future.
Let's think about the shortage of energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet by 5,000 times more energy than we use in one year.
They come to the Earth 16 percent of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about it, it's about <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, the MIT published a study that shows that the end of the decade of the United States, solar electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to the 15 cents in the national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about the wars right now.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed the Voyager spacecraft to the Earth, in 1990, after I spent <unk>
<unk> a famous picture. How do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent water.
Yes, <unk> is saltwater, <unk> two percent is ice, and we fought by the <unk> of the water on the planet, but there's a hope.
It's a technology that's available not 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen -- this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, gave me permission to hold your technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is the size of a small refrigerator.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water to the day of any fresh source -- saltwater, <unk> water, a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola, has just occurred to make a significant test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out, and I've got full confidence in which this will be, Coca-Cola is going to be done in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is a <unk> innovation for this technology which is today.
And we've seen that in mobile phones.
Oh my God, we're going to reach 70 percent penetration penetration of mobile phones in the end of 2013.
<unk> that <unk> warrior has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya than President <unk> 25 years ago.
And to tell you with a smart phone with Google, has access to more knowledge and information that the CEO Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that no one could have predicted before.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video <unk> images, libraries of books and music, diagnostic technology.
Maybe the best thing to get into your health care is.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is something called the X X <unk> <unk> 10 million dollars.
We are challenging the teams of the world so that we can bring these technologies into a mobile device that you speak, and because it has <unk> you can get blood from the finger.
To win it has to make better diagnostics than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the <unk> charge is 25 percent and there are health care workers.
When this device <unk> a RNA virus or DNA that we don't have to call the health system, and first of all, avoiding the epidemic.
But this is the biggest force to produce a world of plenty.
I call it the billion.
The white lines here are the population.
We just spent the mark of <unk> billion.
By the way, the best protection of the population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, going from two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three hundred million minds have never been before <unk> to the global conversation.
What do you want to do these people?
What do you do? What do you <unk>
And instead of a economic collapse will have the greatest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Academy Khan of the Khan Academy and because of the use of impressions in 3D and the computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can give us three billion members of humanity, healthy polite and <unk>
How about a voices never before <unk>
What if we give them to <unk> wherever they are, a voice to be heard, and be able to act for the first time?
What do these 3,000 <unk>
And if you are contributions we can't <unk>
One thing I learned with the X Prize, is that small teams led by their passion with an objective of course, can do things that were <unk> things that could only make the big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that probably heard of.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how you fold the protein.
The folds determine the structure and the functionality.
It's something very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a <unk> problem.
They played with this college professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people went around and started <unk>
And it has been shown today that the machinery of recognition of human patterns is better <unk> protein than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me an enormous confidence in the future is that we have more power as people to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the <unk> of the <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion minds that are helped to work on the solution of big challenges and doing what we should do.
We have over in front of decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very intriguing idea.
The <unk> of the point of <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give you three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
You might think it <unk> <unk> but it didn't.
<unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was <unk>
It caught it up to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red Red <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, about the Galapagos and elsewhere, so that does not have anything special.
But the case is that we still come in the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
<unk> are still saying they follow <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a pond, in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The lagoon was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, of some <unk>
There was <unk> from about 20 <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good time, so it became more than the middle in Ghana.
When I was there 27 years later, the amount of fish had dropped in half.
I went to five centimeters away.
<unk> a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing changed, but it's all changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s <unk> started in the <unk> Europe conducted a lot of developmental projects.
<unk> development was <unk> to the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty bad -- <unk> <unk>
I went out fishing in it, and we conducted studies in the southern Sea of China in <unk> and above all, in the <unk> Sea.
What we captured was something called <unk>
<unk> I know, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture were <unk> other animals that are in the bottom.
And most of the fish are blobs of tiny blobs of <unk> the remains of coral reefs.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
Within a year, you do a study and then start commercial fishing.
The background is going to be a solid coral background, in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not the <unk>
We once captured a alive.
I wasn't <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what the fishermen collect every time you go to an area where they never have fish.
But no <unk> left.
<unk> the world, but we don't remember.
I had the starting point of starting to start on the process without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have <unk> biodiversity, how many <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time, change because people do things with <unk>
Each of the generation to use the <unk> images at the beginning of their conscious life as normal and extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive the loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the landscape of changes.
And at the end of the end, it will keep some <unk>
And that, in large ways, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that they don't are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem is affecting people when societies die, they kill animals without knowing what they've done to about generations later.
Because obviously, an animal that's very <unk> before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose little animals.
Even if this doesn't perceive as a big <unk>
Eventually, we focus on big animals, and in a poor sea of large fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
Eventually, there are a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know that it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they'll be doing it because the evidence presented in a earlier way, is not the way they would expect that evidence has to have.
For example, the anecdote that some of the <unk> as that a <unk> like a lot of fish in this area can't be used -- or, typically not use the scientists of fish, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in <unk> societies.
From there the enormous paper that can be a protected marine zone.
Because with marine areas, we actually <unk> the past.
<unk> the past that people can't conceive of, because the starting point is running and it's extremely low.
That's for people who can see a protected marine zone and they can benefit from the vision that they <unk> which allows them to erase their point of <unk>
And what about people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the people in the Midwest, for example?
I think there the arts and cinema can fill in the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of <unk> Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in the <unk> Bay Bay.
And you'll have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were <unk> with the movie <unk> talk about the story of <unk> which is why we were doing with the <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
And so my <unk> the only one that to give, is to <unk> <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> manager and look at YouTube YouTube in a professional way.
It's true.
So today, we're going to see why videos they do viral and what the importance does it is.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed very, very difficult.
But today, the web video does that any of us, or our actions, copper <unk> in a part of our world culture.
Anybody can be famous on the Internet in a <unk>
It goes up over 48 hours of video to YouTube for a minute.
And of those, just a small percentage of them is <unk> gets a <unk> and it makes cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, communities and <unk>
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
KT: Oh, my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video outside his home in the National Park of <unk>
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the <unk> in the rise of popularity of last summer.
<unk> was not intended to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
There was a lot of videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this impression that <unk> the <unk>
The creators of trends like Jimmy <unk> are present and interesting things and <unk> them into a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  He's Friday, in Saturday -- you have to start on a Saturday   -- you all want to get the end of a week, the weekend.   <unk> Friday. <unk> the Friday.  KA: Don't think we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> <unk> is one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have come from nothing.
So what did this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other <unk> they're also a <unk>
But what happened this day, this Friday <unk>
Well, I took <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science -- was one of the first people in making a joke on Twitter.
But the important thing is that one person or a group of <unk> <unk> a view of view and share it with a very broad audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who shares this big joke in the inner self, then starts talking about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each of the other days.
Unlike the 20th century, unlike the 20th century, this communal participation is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation, animation with a <unk> music.
That's the way that's it.
This year, you saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know there's a version of three hours that has seen four million times.
So even the cats saw this video.
And there are cats who saw other cats see the video.
But what's important here is creativity that I woke up between the Internet <unk>
There was <unk>
Somebody made an old version of it.
And then international viruses.
All of a sudden, a whole community of <unk> did this would happen to be a stupid joke to something that we can all form part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or <unk>
What do I script might have been written by that <unk>
In a world where two days of video are lifted up just the only unique and unexpected thing that these things have done.
When a friend said to me that I had to see this great video of a kind of protest against the <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit I didn't even go too much.
Casey <unk> I <unk> you don't circulate by the <unk> but there are often obstacles that prevent you <unk> for <unk>
KA: Thanks to the surprise and his humor, Casey <unk> made five million to see and understand his idea.
So this approach is worth new things we make creative form.
And all of this leads us to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of tendency, creative communities of participation, completely unexpected, are features of a new kind of media, a new culture, that we all have access and the audience that defines the <unk>
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> began on YouTube.
Don't <unk> permission to express their ideas.
Now we're all a little owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- they're hardly the current media -- but <unk> the future entertainment.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had supported in the unique hope of unity and freedom of his country.
<unk> as the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that his life had been totally in vain.
The words for so much time, I was now afraid of, <unk>
They become quiet.
He died out of the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never knew.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My job was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story was trying to <unk> but I got it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> <unk> into the sea.
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years old when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two little girl.
For her, life had been moved to an <unk> task to escape her family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> <unk> which challenges the fiction, a boat is <unk> into the cold sea of ship.
All the adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear was the <unk> rape and death.
Like most adults -- my mother was wearing poison.
If we were <unk> I would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the motor, the <unk> diving into every wave, and the vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember the <unk> who came several times, but they were fooled by the courage of men on our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to run for six hours.
But I do remember the lights from the platform on the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and passed off the journey was too much to it; and the first apple I tried to do with the <unk> of the <unk>
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations shaping a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> suburb whose population is comprised of <unk>
Unlike the suburbs of the middle class -- whose existence was in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of Texas <unk> among people who had one thing in common: They were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, and then on a assembly line of cars, working six days, double turn.
Still, I found out time to study English and get a degree on IT <unk>
We were poor.
And all of the dollars were <unk> and established an extra randomness in English and mathematics, it wouldn't matter what was supposed to be <unk> that usually was his <unk>
Two pairs of average for school, one to hide the holes from the other.
A school uniform goes to <unk> because it had to last six years.
And there were weird and <unk> about the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> back home."
At home.
Something in me are <unk>
I was compiling determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my mother, and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we took care about our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at home.
My mother had <unk> all of the ship.
And my task was to be wakes up until his <unk> <unk> for <unk>
She opened a computer store, then I studied to be <unk> and he opened another business.
And the women would come up with their stories about men who couldn't do the <unk> angry and <unk> and <unk> boys that were trapped between two worlds.
They looked at subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in <unk> worlds.
In one one, it was the classic <unk> student playing with what I <unk> from myself.
In the other hand, I was <unk> in <unk> lives, tragically, <unk> by violence, abuse of drugs and isolation.
But many people were able to help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of <unk> he chose the youngest of the year.
And I was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to another, but its <unk> edges.
As <unk> <unk> <unk> was now <unk> refugee and social activist invited to speak in sites that I had never heard of, and in houses whose existence had never imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retire in the <unk> and the comfort of life at a <unk> suburb -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending the day for almost 20 years old, <unk> over the day of each one and <unk> <unk> the three still in the bed.
And I told my mom I couldn't do it.
I remembered that I was now the same age that she had when we got a ship.
He had never been an option.
<unk> said to me, "and you're not going to be <unk>
So I talked about youth and education and <unk> and <unk>
And the more of that, the more I was talking about -- the more it was <unk> to talk.
I met people from all the roads in life, a lot of them doing what they <unk> living in the boundary of the possible.
And although I finished my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a career race.
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's a stranger, a <unk> new in the scene -- and not just that it's right, but it's something that will be grateful, maybe a gift of the ship.
Because being in the inside, it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world <unk> but not the way we fear.
<unk> that didn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was a energy there, a <unk> optimism -- a rare of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
<unk> to a small group of people who said, <unk> cannot <unk> it was an <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of each day, I was making a giant pot of soup that all <unk>
<unk> it up to the night.
Most of our ideas were fantastic, but some <unk> and we opened up.
I took a decision to move to the U.S.
after a single trip.
My <unk>
Three months later, I had <unk> and the adventure <unk>
Before I finish, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up at a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person they cared.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother was raised alone.
At age 17 became <unk> from a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without the support of her husband, caused a <unk> to the <unk> and take the cause for it, and a lot more <unk> caused when I won.
It can't show us to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the hotel room when she died.
I looked across the <unk> of the shower and I saw her standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell stories and made sure we were still with it.
At night a monk came up and said he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to raise her hand.
I asked her to say, "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you take your hand from the <unk> he said.
"You haven't been <unk>
If there's a nerve on our family that runs through women.
Since those of us and how life built us, we can now see that the men who had come to our lives would have been <unk>
<unk> would have <unk> easily.
I want my own children, and I wonder about the ship.
Who could wish for you, right?
However, I fear the privilege of the easy, right.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, a brave thing in every wave, the <unk> rate of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't count.
I don't know.
But if I could give you and see them -- I would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of <unk> is here in the fourth or fifth row.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> <unk> with the singer <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing changed from the time of the former Indian <unk> <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
And so in that time when you were <unk> the great prince warrior Indian -- he had <unk> <unk> a bow and with a <unk> on the ground, he got water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we had was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that would get me a lot.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I would love this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciating a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow the magic, not <unk>
My grandfather gave me her <unk> <unk>
And this piece for 50 years was to my most favorite thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of <unk> and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the sense of mobile phones, the <unk> <unk>
<unk> our inspiration.
That's why I got <unk> I threw this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, rather than <unk>
<unk> books from 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a <unk> device to connect to the readers of the entire world.
You can know how we take the book out.
Where we are.
Put the text with the image, photography, sound and touch.
<unk> becomes more and more <unk>
But what does that do that?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive application for the iPad.
It says, "You get your fingers on every light."
And so --  He says, "This box belongs -- "I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
In a number of moments I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live because of the GPS -- that comes led to me.
So my little girl inside is excited to all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot of magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but to that magic of childhood to those ideas that <unk> children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar was always exciting for me.
So here, we have to shift the iPad to release the fireflies.
And actually, they light your way into what the hell of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a girl was that a whole <unk> galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I drag into this magical device inside the device.
And this opens a map.
In every book of fantasy has always been maps but they've been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you over the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another very important thing to me is to create Indian content and contemporary age.
Here are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts -- <unk> the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the chambers of <unk> for millennia, in an old and <unk>
So we're bringing them back into a personal <unk>
In a story that deals with current issues like environmental crisis.
And, talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems over the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> they haven't left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can pull our kids into the natural world with their technology.
One of the <unk> interactions is this adventure that we have to go out abroad, take the camera or iPad, and we collect images of different natural objects.
As a girl I had a lot of <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For some reason the kids don't do it.
So to reclaim this ritual of the childhood you have to go out and, in a chapter, we would take a picture to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
You create a digital collection of pictures that then you can put on the Web.
A little boy in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, today I saw a <unk>
A child from India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Inside the variants of connection between magic, Earth and technology is many possibilities.
In the next book, we have an interaction in which one comes out with the iPad and the video on, and by reality, <unk> you see a bunch of <unk> <unk> that appear on the inner plants inside the house.
At a moment, the screen is full of leaves.
And you have to do the sound of wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We go to a world where the forces of nature is associated with technology, and the magic and technology come to each other.
We bring the energy from the sun.
We're moving to our kids and ourselves into the natural world and to that magic, <unk> and child love that we sat through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects from <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a Freedom of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little coffee cup or you and asked patients, family and <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we usually think that this is one of the biggest problems for all of us, or maybe not all of us, but most of the projects of <unk> they fail, because we stopped listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale -- it's something very simple.
It has a <unk> and <unk>
Every morning I <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to get to <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I would <unk> it sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is not at the same time that I need for <unk> or any urgency of that style -- but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi <unk> and before I climb into my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a <unk> lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure pressure to help patients -- because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients quit smoking.
On the other hand, it can <unk> to move people from their chairs and together develop some activity <unk> to have more control of their health.
From the next week I would be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people will <unk> from their houses, taking their blood pressure to their doctor, and share it with each other, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where the patients assume a position, they come back to regain the control and to be captains of its own <unk> but it can also help care of health care because of the challenges that we face, like firing the costs of care <unk> the <unk> of demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like this, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did want to share with you with a video with you.
We all have checks of navigation <unk>
Maybe we have them in our phones.
We know perfectly where ATM machines are in <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find out of fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked them, but nobody <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was to do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We create a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> please say, <unk> where, and when it's open, because they sometimes open up in a <unk> <unk> <unk> and other are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> were already introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we made an application for the iPad.
We created an application for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and somebody would <unk> you can use your iPhone, and the next weeks to use their cell phone, to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I would like to introduce this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but as a <unk>
And we want to make it globally globally.
We're <unk> all the colleagues in the world, in other universities, to help us to find, and to act as a center for the <unk> of <unk> all over the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also wanted to invite companies around the world that could help us <unk> these <unk>
You could be <unk> or <unk> people, for example, to see if the <unk> that's shown is still in its place.
Please <unk> in this and not only improve health, but to take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, these are photographs that can't take with their cameras.
My interest in photography was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
I mixed with my oldest passion for the drawing but it was a little bit different because of using the camera -- the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when the <unk>
For me photography had more to be in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start in the press the <unk>
<unk> like this: a building on a very <unk> road <unk>
But he has an unexpected turn.
And even though it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful ones, but with the common goal to maintain the standard of the line.
And when I say realism I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that I can <unk> but I always want to think that seems to have been captured in a way like photography.
<unk> where you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It's got more to capture an idea that you capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them seem <unk>
It's the details or the <unk>
<unk> light?
What is it creates the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you perceive on a slippery surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is a <unk>
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we took different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we all can relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way can create something that doesn't seem to happen as if it existed.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
And so we <unk> the brain because the brain doesn't accept the fact that it doesn't make sense.
And I see the same process when we combine the photographs.
It's really about combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture look like realistic I think they're those in which we don't even perceive things around us in our daily lives.
But when we combine pictures it's very important to be <unk> because otherwise something is wrong.
So I'd like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Second, the pictures <unk> must have the same kind of light.
And these two images are doing with these <unk> they were taken to the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect present.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
You might think that this is the image of a landscape and the bottom line is <unk>
But this picture is completely composed of photographs of different places.
In the personal I think it's easier to create a place which is still because you don't need to put the ideas on your head.
But it takes a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to try and find the different locations for the puzzle of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured in a fishing journey.
<unk> are from a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a sharp <unk>
And yes, even I made red the house on the top of the island so that it looks more <unk>
So in order to achieve realistic outcome, I think it needs to be planning.
You start with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here each piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures -- you can be very beautiful and at very <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing you a slide about technology, very boring <unk>
Please can you <unk>
This is a diagram any one I took from a folder mine.
I'm not really interested in showing you the details of it, but the overall thing.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus power of local area networks.
The interesting thing about this is that this is how many other we tend to see, is sort of a straight line on scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude at the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about <unk> curves, it's something new.
This is something weird here.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please light the lights.
<unk> more intensity because I write about paper.
Why did we solve technological <unk> <unk>
The answer is that if you draw them into a normal curve that, say, these are the years, or some of the time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I would like to ask you the diagram would look something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if you ask for example, some other technology -- like transportation, on a logarithmic curve would be very <unk> we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a perceptual change.
If technology technology as fast as the last decade, we could take a cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go back to that rhythm.
There's no amount of <unk> in the history of technological development of economic growth, which every few years will solve orders of magnitude.
The question that I want to do is -- looking at these <unk> curves, we see that they don't keep forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
We had one of two things.
Or well it will become a typical <unk> I know how to come up with something completely different, or maybe something like that.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, to a new shape.
So what I'm trying to ask, and to ask yourself, is: What is that new way that it takes over the world?
Where new state is going to be the world?
The transition is very, very <unk> if we are engaged in it.
I remember as a child as the future occurred in 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future and see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel that something is <unk>
We can feel it. We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have much sense to think about 30 or 50 years, because everything will be so different than extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition that <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit of things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand is taking distance and look at the long-term things.
The scale of time in which I'd like to do this is time of life on Earth.
I think this picture makes sense if we look at each billion years.
So you go back about about two million years ago when the Earth was a large <unk> rock with many chemicals that <unk> around them.
If we look at the way that chemical <unk> we give us a sense of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start to understand the origin of the RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is, at that time, it had been floating around with some <unk> of oil with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those droplets of oil contain a particular combination of chemicals that made them to incorporate materials from the outside and then <unk> grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most invasive forms of the oil oil <unk>
But those droplets were not living in the current sense, because each of them contained a random recipe for chemicals.
And every time it <unk> <unk> a distribution distribution of chemicals that <unk>
So every <unk> was a little bit different.
In fact, drops that somehow become better at the time of bringing the chemical <unk> and more chemical <unk> and more chemical <unk>
Mostly, they lived more time, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, a very simple chemistry, but things got interesting when these droplets learned the trick.
Somehow we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to hold information, which was the recipe for a cell in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this Darwinian evolution -- a writing system that allowed you to register what they were to be able to do it.
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved 2.5 million years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same system of writing.
In fact, every living being is expressed in exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did only for <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of a white dust that I try to hide at the airport of the airport.
But <unk> Tom <unk> <unk> the code has the common letters that we tend to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data into this piece of DNA and I took it 10 to 22 times.
So if somebody wants 100 million copies of my personal card, I have a lot for all the <unk> in fact, for every single person in the world and it's here.
If you were a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and have it spread around the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells be happy, another billion years.
But then another big step occurred in the things that things <unk> very different and was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information forming the cell cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
That way, for example, evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and <unk> them to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of <unk> because the bacteria communicate.
This communication led to the communities that, in a way, they were together in a way, and there was a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, or whatever if a community was very successful all the individuals of that community became more <unk> and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the tipping point occurred when these communities came up so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write the entire recipe for the community together in a chain of DNA.
The next stage interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage we have communities <unk> communities of many kinds of different cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that no longer act alone.
The skin cell is not without the heart, or the <unk> or the brain, etc.
So these communities evolved and became more interesting levels than the cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These were starting to <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't make more than process information in community.
These are <unk> structures.
<unk> are the <unk> devices that process the information that those cell cell communities.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community that are responsible for <unk> to understand and convey the information.
Those are the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the time of evolutionary time.
So one organism, for example, learn not to eat some fruits because he knew evil and sick the last time they ate it.
That could happen during the life of a organism given that they had been built on these information processing structures that would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by death of individuals who ate that fruit.
And so the fact that the fastest nervous system built up to fundamentally dramatic evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in the time you need to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea of a <unk> idea.
I'm here sitting here emitting some <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea: <unk> and <unk> in his heads that keeps certain analogy to mine.
But we take something very complicated as it turns it into sound, on sound sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, like humanity, we've started making <unk>
Now we go through similar periods to the <unk> organisms -- our current methods of record and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a small step in that direction.
The computer -- the computer -- the video tape, the <unk> so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings us to something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You already saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where it produced some evolution with the <unk> program to our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the scales of time again.
The first stages of the story I told you took a billion years each.
The next few stages, the nervous system and the brain, took about hundreds of millions of years.
<unk> the language, etc., they took less than a million years.
And beyond, as the electronics, seems to take a few decades.
The process is <unk> I suppose that <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this <unk> <unk>
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life design computers, and I know that the mechanisms that deals with <unk> would be possible without the recent computer advances.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to be <unk>
I don't know that every transistor is in that machine machine.
There are billions.
And instead of that, with the designers, <unk> designers, we think about a level of abstraction, we put it on the machine and the machine with that something that makes something that you could do before, it gets far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes uses methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method I've been using is the evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates at the scale of microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer -- you can run a hundred million lists of <unk> instructions to chance?
You could run these password sequences at random, running all those programs, and take those to get to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to <unk> numbers, to put a simple example.
So we find the programs that are closer to tidying up numbers.
Of course, you are unlikely that some random sequences of <unk> <unk> -- so none of them did.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that best did the <unk>
<unk> those and <unk> the rest.
And now they <unk> the <unk>
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of <unk> analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that we <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and that the children will <unk> the properties of two programs.
So we get a new generation of <unk> programs that had a little more success.
And we say, "Please repeat <unk>
<unk> again.
<unk> some mutations in it.
And it tries to do it again and try another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or in particular cases, in a few months.
In the end, we end up with programs that are <unk>
In fact, it's a lot more efficient programs than I could have written by <unk>
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to take it to see how they work.
They're very strange programs.
But they play the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security that you get the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that they succeeded.
In fact, their lives are dependent on this.
Once I was in a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he grabs a card and says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> that work together to offer a <unk> <unk> not makes you feel <unk>
We know that the engineering processes work very well when they get complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to do different design processes.
And that allows us to produce a lot more complex things than the average engineering does.
However, we don't understand the whole options that we have.
In that sense, it's in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and be able to run these programs much more quickly.
Okay?
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it looks so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we're at an analog moment to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to think that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of what it is.
But now it comes to lunch and I think I'll stop here before I was <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've taken time enough to let me give up part of my <unk> <unk> in that.
Before I try the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're near the end of the end, the World Wide <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of coming out, <unk> talks about the statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you have heard of.
It's called the average of <unk>
And we talked about 300 of a <unk> that <unk> 300.
That means that the bat <unk> <unk> three than 10 times.
That means to launch the ball into the field of play without being <unk> and anyone who tried to <unk> at the first base -- not to get time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how to call it for a <unk> <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of the stars.
You know how to call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's someone 10 <unk> gives four.
<unk> like high Ted Williams, the last player at the Best League of <unk> in running more 400 hits in a regular season of train.
Now I <unk> this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or perhaps less awkward, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they are <unk> to a surgeon who has a record record on <unk>
So it doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that you live in a place away and a dear person has two <unk> <unk> and her family doctor derives into a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is <unk>
But do you know something?
She's getting a lot of this year.
And they have been <unk>
This isn't working.
But I will ask you.
What do you think should be the average of the <unk> of a heart surgeon or <unk> a nurse or a <unk>
<unk> pretty well.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in medicine knows the hits from a good surgeon, from a doctor or a <unk>
What we do, however, is to send them to the world, and I fell on to me, with the <unk> of being perfect.
You'd never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman <unk> until a blood test.
<unk>
<unk> in my little <unk> in the nurses of nurses at the General Hospital of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
Out of my anatomy, <unk> the origin of the <unk> the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the <unk> <unk> and not standard.
And I even knew the <unk> diagnosis of how to classify the <unk>
And meanwhile, more and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated.
And <unk> from the medicine of medicine with the impression that if you were going to do everything, then you would know everything, or as possible, close to everything, because I would love my mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto when they brought the lady back to the emergency service where I was working.
I was assigned to the <unk> service.
And when emergency emergency room was to go back to a cardiologist I played that patient.
and reporting the head of residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when <unk> I heard a sound <unk> in both sides, what I had a heart heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working and instead of pump your blood forward, the blood goes to your lungs, these are blood <unk> and so there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did this and I got to work on the treatment that I would <unk>
I gave him <unk> and medication to relieve the pressure in her heart.
I gave him <unk> <unk> <unk> so that it could be <unk>
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very good.
And that's when I made the first <unk> the sent to her home.
I actually made two more errors.
I sent her home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't get up the phone and I didn't do what I should have done, I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, I would have been able to bring information <unk>
Maybe I did this for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident to make constant attention to me.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that could take care of my patients without even <unk>
The second mistake I made was worse.
When you would send it to her home, I didn't see a voice on my inside that would say, <unk> is not a good idea. I don't think so.
In fact, it was so unsure that until I asked the nurse that he <unk> the <unk> "Do you think it's okay if you go to your <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said full <unk> "Yeah, I think I'm okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he said that he wrote the <unk> and the ambulance with the ambulance to her home.
And I went back to the hospital room.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the gut.
I kept with my work.
At the end of the day, I was planning to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot, where I was my car to go home. I did something I don't do normally,
It went through the emergency emergency service at home.
And there is another nurse, not the one that I <unk> from the <unk> lady before, but the other one said three words that most of the <unk> <unk>
Other specialists who fear them too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and is that we see <unk> patients.
The three words is: remember you?
"Did you remember the patient's <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
They said, "Well, she <unk> the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
In an hour of having come to his house, after I gave her high school, she suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the ambulance brought the emergency room with a <unk> blood pressure of <unk> which means a shock <unk>
I just breathe and it was blue.
Your emergency personnel <unk> all its resources.
They gave medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put an artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mix of feelings because after the <unk> was on intensive therapy, and he was waiting for all the hope they were <unk>
And in the two or three days it was apparent that I never <unk>
I had permanent <unk>
The family got together the family.
And in eight or nine days, they were terrified of what was happening.
And by the ninth day, they left it. Black <unk> wife and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
The weeks later, I was interested in it and I experienced it for the first time -- shame that exists in our medical culture and sat alone by <unk> <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't touch them with your colleagues.
You make peace and never make that mistake.
It's that shame that gives a teaching.
The shame <unk> I talk about is that makes us feel very wrong with it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did badly, we are bad.
And I felt.
And it wasn't my <unk> He was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure I would <unk> things and assured me that I don't <unk>
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did I send her home?
And in my worst <unk> Why did I made such a stupid mistake?
Why did I chose medicine?
Little to that feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And in one day, he opened the sky and finally came out the sun and wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with me that if you were going to raise the efforts to be perfect to make no more mistakes I would do to listen to those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it turned to happen.
Two years later, I was <unk> in the emergency room in a community hospital in the north of Toronto, and I got a man from 25 years with a pain in <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I watched him because I was a little bit <unk>
He sent him out of penicillin, and sent him home.
But while he ran to the door was following her <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my guard, my boss asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And I made the three words: <unk>
Remember the patient who saw by a pain in <unk>
And he came back and I had no <unk>
I had a potentially fatal condition.
You can take it for Google. It's an infection, not the throat, but from the top of the top and it can cause the closing of those tracks.
He was hoping she didn't die.
It gets <unk> antibiotics because it goes <unk> and <unk>
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then <unk> and I went back to work, until it happened again and over again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were at 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a calculation of <unk>
It turned out an X-ray of <unk> but it turned out normal. A colleague who was checking the patient <unk> some sensitivity in the bottom right-hand corner and called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I gave him a liquid command for <unk> and I asked my colleague to <unk> him.
And I reviewed it, and when I noticed some sensitivity on the bottom right-hand corner, he called the surgeon.
Both of them were operated and they recovered well.
But every case I was obsessed with me <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as a lot of colleagues say, is a <unk>
The most significant ones have been over the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and support.
And here's the problem: if I can't tell you and talk about my mistakes, I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do you show you this to not make the same <unk>
If I go back to a place like this, I would have no idea what you think of me.
When did that last time you heard somebody talk about failure, after failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, as a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg online, she would have difficulty looking at the eyes.
This is the system we have.
<unk> denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> the ones that make mistakes and the ones that <unk> the ones that don't sleep and the ones that I meet, the ones who have <unk> outcomes and the ones that have great outcomes.
And it's almost like an <unk> reaction as a antibodies that starts to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you take away from medicine to people who make mistakes stay safe to us.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and medical journalism, I have made a personal study of <unk> medical and failures to learn how possible, from the first article that I wrote for the first article that I wrote to my <unk> <unk> Black <unk> Black <unk> white, white <unk>
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where the errors are happening every single day, in which one in 10 <unk> drugs are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system that infections, <unk> infections are more and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, they die of <unk>
The U.S. Medical Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so they're things.
A self-organizing system where knowledge will be absorbed every two or three years, and we didn't care about us.
<unk> sleep <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain in the chest, and it comes up with <unk> eyes, and with breath to alcohol and all of a sudden, my story <unk> <unk>
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things in the same way.
And my patients are not cars. They don't <unk> their symptoms always in the same way.
For all of this, errors are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we get rid of us and we remove all the professional or remove all of the <unk> or evil -- well, I'll be no one.
And with respect to people who don't want to talk about their <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white, <unk> <unk> is a custom to say, "This is my worst <unk> I would say to everyone, from the ambulance to the head of <unk> <unk> "This is my worst <unk> <unk> blah, blah, "What are your <unk> And I <unk> the microphone towards them.
And their students were <unk> <unk> <unk> their head and <unk> saliva and just started telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> be able to say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> physician is human, they know human, they accept it, and they don't hide their mistakes, but he tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
<unk> their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the errors of other people not with trying to <unk> but a loving way to support and support for everybody else.
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a medical doctor.
I'm a human, <unk>
I feel a lot of it, but I strive to learn something that can transmit others.
I don't know what about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words -- I remember myself.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently did a survey of more than 2,000 people and the average number of choices that you say to pick an average American. It's about 70 to the day.
Not long ago in research followed for a week to a group of firms.
The researchers recorded the different tasks of <unk> by these CEOs and the time that they were going to engage in making decisions about those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> jobs for week.
Naturally, every work involved in many, many <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 60 percent required an hour or more of your time.
Now think about your election.
Do you know how many of you belong to the <unk> <unk> and how many of the <unk>
How does the way that those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> to choose to <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, like I am blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, you're ready to hear about the <unk> <unk> problem.
Thank you.
As a graduate student at the University of Stanford, I was at least at the very <unk> level, at least at the time it was so sophisticated.
His name was <unk>
It was almost like going to a park park.
There was about 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> more than 500 different fruits of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of water <unk> And this was when we got water from a <unk>
I loved going to that store, but at one occasion, I asked me, why do you never buy nothing?
This is the shelf from the oil <unk>
They had over 75 different classes, including those who were in <unk> <unk> that came from <unk> trees.
I once decided to go to a manager and asked him, "Would you just this strategy of providing all of these <unk>
He pointed me to the buses full of tourists that came up every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with the <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had <unk>
<unk> a post for <unk> right to the shop.
We put out there <unk> six <unk> or 24 flavors different and look at two things: First, what other people were willing to stop <unk> <unk>
More people stopped when I had <unk> a 60 percent that when there was just six, 40 percent.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a cup of <unk>
So here we found the opposite effect.
Who stopped when there was <unk> only three percent got to buy <unk>
When I had six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, the people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six, if they were in jail.
Well, decide that we don't buy <unk> it's probably going to give us <unk> less is good for conserving the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the <unk> of choices is affecting us <unk> decisions.
We decided to not decide, even when this isn't <unk>
Now the subject of the day, the financial worker.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in which we see the decisions about savings savings for about a million Americans, from a million Americans, from a million Americans, from about 650 <unk> plans.
We were interested in looking at whether the number of <unk> available in savings plans for retirement, <unk> program to people to save the future.
And we discovered that there was a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two to 59 different choices.
We found that the bigger the number of funding were less participation.
So if we look at the extremes, we see that in the plans that they offer two funds, the rate of involvement was 70 or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that I offered about 60 dollars, the rate of involvement on the 1960s.
It turns out even if you decide to participate, when there's more choices, even in that case, there is negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the longer it was the number of choices, more people being <unk> by avoiding the actions or hedge funds.
The more choices, they were more willing to invest in the market accounts.
But none of these are important decisions are the ones that we <unk> to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three major negative consequences to offer more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that we <unk> the decision, that <unk> even though this is against self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance, and in health.
They're more likely to pick things less <unk> but objectively they get better.
The main reason is that we're going to start looking at that massive variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for aesthetic <unk> and choosing from that awesome <unk>
Today I want to spend it -- four simple techniques that we've made in a way or another, in different research, so you can test it in your business.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it has never been more true than today, that less is more.
People always bother when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in <unk>
But actually what we're looking at every time is that if you choose to cut, get rid of strange <unk> <unk> will have a increase in sales <unk> the costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> at 15, they saw 10 percent <unk>
When the Golden Golden <unk> eliminated the products for <unk> of cats that are less <unk> increase in <unk> by two <unk> greater sales and less costs.
You know that today's <unk> on average, they offer 45,000 products.
In a grocery store, you have 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in today's world is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce on the tin.
In the world of the financial savings, I think one of the best examples that have come up on how to handle the choices is the <unk> of David <unk> the Harvard test.
All of the Harvard employees are <unk> automatically to a fund of life.
People who do want to choose, you give them 20 dollars, not 300 or more.
You know that people often say, "I don't know how to <unk>
All of them are <unk>
The first thing I do is to ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that we have between those choices.
And if your employees can't afford it, they won't be able to do their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that I would be willing to offer the people in this audience with a holiday with all the paid road to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want to give you an applause if you're ready to take the offer of <unk>
<unk> Okay, so anybody who's ready to accept the deal.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who's ready for that <unk>
I think I really actually hit the <unk>
All right.
In fact, you had more information on the first trial, which in the number two, but I can tell you, and say that they thought that the second time it was <unk>
Because the images were made to look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of <unk> which is <unk>
For people to understand the differences of choices, they have to understand the consequences of each reason, and the consequences must feel very <unk> very concrete
Why don't people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average, when you use debit cards or credit that when it uses <unk>
Because it doesn't seem true money.
It turns out to make it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get <unk>
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
At that meeting, <unk> exactly like <unk> we did a little <unk>
What we added was to ask the staff that you would think about the positive things that they would spend in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was a rise in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the number they were interested in saving or what they wanted to place in their account of <unk> <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can drive more categories than choices.
For example, this is a study that we did in a field of magazines.
We saw that at the retail <unk> on the middle of the <unk> the exhibition show can contain <unk> different kinds to <unk>
But you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two set of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> to give you a <unk>
<unk> Well, there's a few of them.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> to give you a <unk>
Well, something else.
Turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and on the right is <unk> but you know what?
This framework is completely useless.
The categories must indicate something that they didn't know when they <unk>
You often see this problem with these huge <unk>
I'm supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can drive a lot more information than we think about it, if you just <unk> a little bit.
We need to increase complexity gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a good decision <unk> buy a car.
This is a German manufacturer of cars that allows us to completely <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions, to build your car.
And these decisions vary in the number of options that offers each one.
<unk> <unk> of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
What I'm going to do is they vary the order that the decisions come out.
So half of the clients are going to go from lots of choices, 56 colors, just like <unk> four boxes.
The other half of the clients are going to go from a few options, <unk> four <unk> at 56 colors.
And what am I going to <unk>
How about where you are.
If you get the <unk> <unk> <unk> in every decision, it indicates that you're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones that go from a lot of options to type, including the <unk> button and over again, and more.
The <unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, they go there.
The same information, the same number of choices.
The only thing I did was to disrupt the order that the information is presented.
If we start with it, you learn <unk>
Although the pick box of change does not tell any of the preferences of interior patterns, in all ways we prepare us to choose.
We're excited about a product that we're building now has more <unk> with the process.
<unk>
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> alternate alternatives -- <unk> -- we can drive more categories with less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques I've presented to them were designed to help manage <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their own business, or for people who work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is to be careful about <unk>
And the more careful be in our choices we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1960s in Germany in East Germany <unk> if you had a <unk> machine <unk> to the government.
I had to register a piece of text example with the machine.
And this allows the government to track the origin of the texts.
If they found a script with the wrong message you could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West, we don't think that someone could do this, so much that this brings the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer of any big manufacturer and print a page, that page will end up having a yellow yellow print on every page that makes a pattern that makes them either one and on your printer.
That's happening today.
And no one seems to be <unk> a lot of it.
This is an example of the ways our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the network.
If you look at what's going on in the online world, we can put attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you <unk>
as Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
Your mobile phone, it's very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use <unk> to earn a lot of money, large amounts.
There are really many instances of online online <unk> that would be <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys do their <unk> on the line, but they do it by illegal <unk> using banking <unk> to steal money from our bills when we shop in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy on a <unk> computer.
The U.S. secret service, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account was <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know your <unk>
And I say today it's more likely for any of us to be a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going wrong.
In the future, most nuclear crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in importance is not driven by the money.
There is another thing that moves, they motivate them the protests, they motivate them the opinions, they motivate you.
Groups like Anonymous have been <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a prominent role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> criminals that make it for money, the <unk> as Anonymous who do for protest and the last group are the national <unk> the governments that <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of a government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is a <unk> authority of the Netherlands, or, actually, it was.
<unk> the last fall because of a <unk>
<unk> the safety of the site and attack a <unk>
Last week, I asked myself in a meeting with elected government representatives asking one of the leaders if they were to say, <unk> death of people because of the attack at <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So how people die because of a suicide attack.
<unk> is an authority authority.
<unk> <unk>
Why do they serve <unk>
Well, you need to have a website with <unk> services, <unk> services like <unk>
Except that <unk> a foreign authority.
And that was the <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt, the <unk> protesters based on April secret police on April 2011 and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there was a few notes of a company based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools for <unk> the communications of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for <unk> <unk>
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide us tools for governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago was found by <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by German government officials to research on their own citizens.
If you are <unk> in a criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
It <unk> the connection to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to online discussions to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious response should be, "Well, it looks like something wrong, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in game privacy.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could be trusted.
<unk> directly in any future government, in a administration we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that you care about in the next 50 years.
This is where I live, I live in Kenya, in the south part of Yellowstone National Park.
These are the cows from my dad, deep down, and behind the cows, the National Park of Nairobi.
The National Park of Nairobi does not have fences at most of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate outside the park.
And predators, like the <unk> and they are doing this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the one who killed at night, and as soon as we were getting in the morning and found it dead and felt very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and that's why we value that much.
So I grew up <unk> a lot like lions.
<unk> are warriors who protect our community and livestock -- and they're also angry with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in Yellowstone National Park.
One child in my community, six to the age of the age of the age of the age of his father and this was the same thing that was happening to me.
So I had to find a way to fix this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought about lions I was afraid.
But I realized that this is actually not <unk> because even helping the lions to see the pen in a long way.
I didn't give me <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
I was trying to <unk> the lions so they believed that I was near the <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.  They came the first day and saw the <unk> and they looked at it, but the second day, they went and said, "This thing is not moving.  So <unk> and they killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day, lions came from.
I found that lions are afraid of light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on which it would turn on and to turn out the lights.
And this is a little lamp of a <unk> <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar panel load the battery and the battery <unk> the electric box -- I call it a transformational.
And the <unk> box makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> you get outside, because that's where lions.
And this is how you see the lions when they come at night.
The lights <unk> and <unk> lions to think that I'm walking around the <unk> but I'm sleeping on my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never went back to have trouble with lions.
And the neighborhood house you heard the idea.
One of them is this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals the lions and asked me if I could put the lights on.
I said yes.
The <unk> You can see at the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've put in seven houses in my community and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also being used by all Kenya, and frightening to other predators as <unk> <unk> and it's also being used to tear elephants from farms.
Because of this invention, I was fortunate enough to get a scholarship on one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise funds.
I even took my friends to my community and set up lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was just a kid in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> the cows from my father, and I used to see planes that would someday be within one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in the airplane for the first time.
My big dream is to become an engineer and a pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows from my dad and the lions, we can be with lions with no conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to listen to a story like anything.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: Are you working on other artificial <unk>
What's the next one in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to make a fence with a <unk> CA: It's about <unk>
<unk> I know you already invented electric communication, but I want to do mine.
CA: I was taking it once, right? I have tried it before, but I have tried it before, but I got a <unk>  CA: When I got the swim, Richard <unk> you're something big.
We go to <unk> every step from my friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best of the Earth.
And I grew up singing a song called "No anything."
And I felt so proud.
In school, we will be <unk> all the time studying the history of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan are enemies.
Although I was sometimes wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend all of my life in North Korea, until everything changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public <unk>
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I had never been hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That said, "When I <unk> this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two days.
We're putting together on the floor, and our bodies are so destroyed, we're ready to die."
I was very critical.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At a little time, when I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead on the street, holding a child in her arms looking at his face of her mother, without being able to do anything.
Nobody <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine headed to North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only few survived eating grass, insects and <unk>
They also became more and more prevalent the power of energy, all of me all around me, was completely dark at night except for the sea lights in China, just crossing the river from my home.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korean on the night compared to the African countries.
This is the <unk> river that serves from North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes it looked like bodies floating in the river, actually.
I can't reveal the details of how I get out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine I was sent to China to live with <unk> lives.
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined I would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life would be like Syrian <unk>
But I soon learned that it's not only hard, but it's also dangerous because refugee refugees in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destination in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was actually done when I was arrested for the Chinese police and <unk> me in the police station.
Someone had been accused of being <unk> so I <unk> my skills in the Chinese language and asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an official said to another, "This was a fake report. She's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Africa are looking for the <unk>
But many can be arrested for the Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Although the <unk> had eventually been released after an international pressure worked.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> <unk> or executed in public.
Even though I was lucky to escape, a lot of other Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language, and find work, all of the world can fit in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I've decided to be going to go to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
It was a much greater challenge than I had expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and south.
We are all <unk> but in the inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
It even went through a <unk> crisis.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country that I could call with me.
Though I went back to life in South Korea was not easy, I did a plan. I started to study for stage <unk>
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities had a little bit of money that I sent to my family, and as a author -- my family was going to be shifted to the force to a way to a way back into the <unk>
They had to flee again.
So I started planning the way to help you escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the road to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea area.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border of North Korea.
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to put it in a way, over 3,000 miles across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> I took a week, and we almost went caught several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and <unk> by a Chinese police officer.
He asked her for all of us and started asking them.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and said to me that they were <unk> who was <unk>
I looked at me, but fortunately I believed it.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all of my money to bribe the guards <unk> in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and imprisoned across the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and imprisoned again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did everything by releasing my family, and we were so close to me, but my family was <unk> in prison to short distance from the embassy of South Korea.
I was going and came between the office of immigration and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But it didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that point, or the voice of a man saying, "What is the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would love to ask.
With my poor English and with a dictionary, I gave him the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and to be two North Koreans and make them prison.
I kept her with all my heart, and I said, "Why am I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I am helping to the <unk> town.
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind of <unk> <unk> a new hope for me and for the <unk> people, when most of the <unk>
And I showed myself that the goodness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the <unk> of hope that the people <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long trip, my family and I joined South Korea.
But achieving its freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they <unk> a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice in the English language of work, jobs.
We can also act as a bridge between people within North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because a lot of us are still in contact with family, still inside, and we send information and money that's helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've received a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans in the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in the South.
This is <unk> <unk> stores and fast food, <unk>
So the planners of the city came together, and they thought, we're going to change the <unk> name for which it represents something else, so they changed in the South L.A., as if this <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles and South <unk>   <unk> <unk> <unk>
Just like <unk> million other Americans, I live in a local <unk> Los Angeles Center, opposed to the <unk> of the food places to take and eat in the car.
The funny thing is that the places of food to carry kills more people than food on the car.
People are starving.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times as long as say, <unk> <unk> that is like 15 miles away.
And I would love to see this happen.
And I ask myself, how do you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go home you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in your <unk>
I see <unk> <unk> and sold as self-driving cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this should stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
<unk> is the problem, and it's the solution.
In addition to me to drive a 45 minutes back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, it was planting a food forest in front of my house.
On a <unk> <unk> we call a <unk>
It's about 45 feet for three feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it.
I said, "Well, I can do what I come up with it, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
So this was how I decided to go.
So my group and I, L.A. <unk> <unk> we get together and we started planting our food forest forest -- trees -- you know, nine bright vegetables.
What we do -- we are a kind of paid group of <unk> made up of <unk> from all the entire city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone got <unk>
The city stood up on top of me and just <unk> me by saying that I had to remove my own garden, the <unk> made it <unk>
And I said, "Come on, right?
A <unk> order for planting food into a piece of land that nobody <unk>  And so I was like, "Well, <unk>
Because this time it wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the written story by Steve <unk> and talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> <unk> members who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were successful.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called me to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of the United States with more <unk>
It's <unk> miles of <unk>
That's 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space for planting <unk> billion plants.
Why on earth does it look like this?
Let's give a plant to give a thousand, 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for the South Pole.
I grew up there. He <unk> my kids in there.
I would love to be part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk>
Like an artist of <unk> that <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, as a piece of canvas, and plants and trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You can see what the Earth can do, if you let it be your canvas.
You just can't imagine how astonishing it is a <unk> and how do we affect people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became a tool of education, transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you need to change the composition of the soil.
We are the land.
They <unk> to see how they affect the kids.
<unk> is the hardest act of <unk> and I thought you can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, they get <unk>
I remember one occasion, which came a mother and her daughter, they were like the <unk> of the night and they were in my garden, and they were very <unk>
I, -- man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I was so close to me with hunger, and this is only <unk> why I do this, people say, <unk> don't you temes that people go to rob your <unk>
What I say, "Oh God no, I don't fear you go to <unk>
It's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want the <unk> but at the time, I want you to <unk> your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a <unk> shelter at the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, I shared their stories about how I had affected and how I had to plant with her mom and his grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've got, like about 50 people that are coming, work and <unk> all in their plan.
If kids grow up, the kids will eat <unk>
If you grow <unk> they'll eat <unk>  But if none of this is <unk> if you don't teach them how food affects your mind and your body, eat blind in front of you.
I see young people who want to work on, but they have this thing that they are <unk> I see little boys of color that are on this path designed for them, that doesn't take them to nowhere.
With <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these kids who are <unk> from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington is produced.
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans -- this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them into <unk>
I don't love me.
I'm not talking about <unk> because it's free, it's not sustainable.
What's curious about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is putting people out of the street, take the boys from the street, who know the joy, the pride and honor to cultivate their own food, by opening the farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everybody to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what is a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
So the <unk> take their <unk> right?
That is their weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to gather with me, well, if you want to see me, don't you call me sitting in comfortable chairs.
If you want to see me, come to the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
<unk> Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> --  <unk> of the <unk>  And you probably all agree with me in which this is a very <unk> road.
It's made of <unk> and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially not in days like today, it raining a lot.
You can have a lot of water in the asphalt that we <unk>
And especially if you go <unk> and these cars go out, that's not very nice.
Also, asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, close to the cities, you'd want a quiet road in the world.
The solution for that is to do roads of asphalt <unk>
The asphalt asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, has pores and water can go through it, so all the water flows flow into the sides and you will have a road because it's easy to drive, and we don't have the water <unk>
Noise will also disappear into these <unk>
Because it's very low, all of the noise to disappear, so it's a very quiet road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> Look at that road the stones from the surface to be <unk>
We first got a stone, then more and more and more and more and more and more, and so --  But you can damage your <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more harm.
Sometimes they can create <unk> with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
So you can really see what the damage is in this material.
It's a asphalt asphalt as I said, so you only have a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> will be <unk> and if you <unk> they'll be <unk> and <unk>
So if you drive the road, you will pull the <unk> like we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we'll probably have a solution.
So what we can do is to use steel wool from that to clean <unk> and we can cut the steel wool into these very small pieces, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel steel in it.
And then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use for <unk> a machine <unk>
<unk> can warmth, especially steel is very good at that.
So what you need to do is they heat the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and the stones <unk> back to the surface.
Today I used a microwave oven, because I can't bring the big <unk> machine here onstage.
<unk> that is a similar system.
I put the sample, I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample right now.
I said we have this industrial machine in the lab to heat the <unk>
So we did a lot of samples there, and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So they gave us a little bit of road, 400 meters of the <unk> highway, where we had to do a test <unk> to test this material.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on the road, and then, of course, this road lasts several years without damage -- that's what we know in practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We did aging the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, we put them together with our <unk> machine and the hobbies and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, in closing, I can say we've made a material using fibers of steel, bringing these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the lives of the surface of the road, including even double the life of the surface. It really will save a lot of money with very simple ones.
And now, of course, they are curious about this as well.
We still have the show here. It's quite hot.
It actually has to cool first before I can show you how it acts it.
But I'm going to make a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember just woken up a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to the BBC Mark <unk> in his little gray radius.
He had a great smile on his face that was unusual at those time, because the news is usually <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> <unk> my father.
I didn't know what it was, but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> <unk> he said.
One morning I never <unk>
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban were <unk> from Afghanistan and they did illegal girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I would love myself as a child to meet my older sister that I could no longer be alone outside to go to a secret school.
It was the only way we were both <unk>
Every single day, we would take a different route for no one could suspect where to <unk>
We had to hide the books in the market so that it would seem to be shopping.
The school was at a house, over 100 of us in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We knew we all knew that we <unk> our lives, the teacher, students and our parents.
Occasionally the school suddenly <unk> a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they did.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to <unk>
We were <unk> but even the school was where we wanted to be.
I was fortunate to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters had a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote <unk> in Afghanistan, <unk> in which his daughter, my mother, went to school, and that's why her father did.
But my foster mother became a teacher.
This is it.
It took two years ago, just to turn our home to girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite <unk>
For him, there was a higher risk in not to educate their children.
During the years of the <unk> I remember that there were moments when I was very frustrated with our life and I was always scared and I wouldn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, "I <unk> me, you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can take your home for a war.
But there's one thing I'm always going to be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will.
So you even want not to <unk>
I have 22 years now.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have more than the middle of my age, and if my family didn't have been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate school in <unk> College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who went to her home for the courage to educate her daughters, was one of the first in <unk>
He was not only <unk> from my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I am the first woman who I've been driving over the streets of Kabul.
My family believe in me.
I am in big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global <unk> of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
That's why we <unk> <unk> the first and maybe the only private school in Afghanistan, a country in which is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see her parents and their families who, like the friends, they were fighting for them, even though they are still in front of an <unk>
As <unk> It's not his real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month ago, he and his daughter went out of the way from <unk> to her village, and literally escaped to be killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get to your house, it's the phone, a voice pointed out that if she kept sending her daughter to school, he would try.
<unk> now, if <unk> said, "but not damaging the future of my daughter by his old and <unk> ideas."
What I've realized is Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the people who <unk> there is a father who recognized the courage of his daughter and see that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean our mothers have not been a key to our success.
In fact, they're often the first <unk> compelling future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls that went to school themselves in <unk> remember, was illegal.
But today, more than three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the United States.
I find Americans see the fragility of changes.
<unk> that these changes didn't last last too much after the retirement of the U.S.
But when I went back to Afghanistan, when I look at students in my school and their parents who <unk> by them, I see a future <unk> and civic change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities <unk> and every day of <unk> girls from <unk>
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
You've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never come back a revolutionary <unk>
They've spent nearly two years since the Tunisian revolution had been inspired by the <unk> of massive <unk> as much as <unk> revolution.
A forces with many other citizens locked inside and outside the country to call a day of <unk> and starting a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and young men who were in the <unk> <unk> each of the regime, carrying <unk> dignity and social justice.
They've shown a courage to face the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the Eastern <unk> to the west to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war, and a few losses from about 50,000 dead -- we managed to liberate our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy sleep, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the Tunisian <unk> regime destroyed the infrastructure and culture and moral structure of society.
<unk> out of the devastation and the challenges, I moved together with many other women, rebuild civil society <unk> <unk> a grassroots transition to democracy and national <unk>
There are a series of about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after each <unk> approximately 300 in <unk>
After a period of about 33 years of <unk> I went to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm I started organizing workshops over the development of training and leadership skills.
With an amazing group of women we founded the <unk> of Women <unk> for <unk> a movement of women, leaders, highly <unk> to advocate for the U.S. autonomy of women and for our right of engaging in the order of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> environment, an environment that was increasingly <unk> that was <unk> of selfish <unk> and <unk> policies.
At the time, our initiative was failing and successful.
Women won a <unk> of National Congress in the first election in 52 years.
However, shortly enough, the exhilaration of elections and revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found out of violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of mosques old and <unk> <unk>
Another day with the news of the murder of the American <unk> and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of the military officers of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of <unk> and their <unk> <unk> human rights <unk> and their lack of the law.
Our society, made a foreign mindset, and it's gone out of the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, which we had at the beginning.
<unk> the <unk> and revenge became the icons of the consequences of revolution.
I'm not here today at all, to talk about our history of success of <unk> <unk> and the election.
Rather, I'm here today to say that we, as nation, we chose evil, we take the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because elections didn't brought peace and stability and security to Libya.
The list of <unk> and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> they brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish <unk> and <unk> for men like women?
Perhaps what was missing not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus that I needed the election, which is only <unk> the polarization and the <unk>
Our nation needs the depiction of women's <unk> more than you need to have the <unk> and quantitative <unk> of it.
We need to stop acting as an outrage and I would call it a few days of anger.
We need to start acting like compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female speech, which is not only <unk> but also put it into practical practice rather than <unk> collaboration instead of competition -- inclusion rather than <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> for war, desperately desperately needs the end of achieving peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and the <unk> between women's <unk> and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it in a <unk> fashion.
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, the word <unk> that is known in all the traditions of <unk> it has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the female and <unk> which embraces all the humanity that men and women, that all tribes and all of the peoples have <unk>
And so as the uterus is completely <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion is <unk> all of the existence.
This is what he tells us was, "My mercy <unk> all the things."
This is what he tells us was, "My <unk> <unk> about my <unk>
That we all <unk> the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a beautiful question that has an equal answer.
This is about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to address is that everybody makes a <unk> Why is it <unk>
Why was somebody going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or a social worker, no teacher in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City for my first work as a writer and editor in the journal <unk>
I had my first <unk> my first <unk> green <unk> and I had a very big <unk>
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I was creating my alma mater, I would love my head with a <unk> loaded with bullets of <unk>
The man, when I loved more than anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times of what I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap <unk> where every year millions of women, and even some men.
Until it could be your story.
I don't look at a typical survivor, of domestic violence.
I'm a Ph.D. in TED University, and I have an MBA in <unk> of <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for <unk> companies, <unk> among them -- Johnson & Johnson, -- I read <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I've been married 20 years old with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all the races, all of the religion -- all the religion and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and the domestic abuse is only happening in <unk> and <unk> and <unk> or <unk> or said in the families, the last place where we want or expect them to find <unk> which is why abuse, domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who would stay with a man who plays it, and I actually got a very typical victim because of my age.
It was 22 years old, and in the United States women were three and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and more than 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by partners, and <unk> and husbands were going to be in the United States.
I also became a typical victim, because I knew nothing about domestic violence or their pattern signs or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold, and <unk> night in January.
I was sitting next to my side in New York City and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first was that he was also a <unk> in the <unk> <unk> university, and he worked on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But the most struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a field of the country.
I had some big <unk> like apples, and a <unk> <unk> and it seemed so sweet.
One of the most intelligent things that did <unk> from the very beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He did about it all at the beginning of <unk> in a <unk>
We started out and loved all of me -- which was so ready, I had gone to Harvard, that I was passionate about helping teenagers, and my job.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer, and as a woman, as anyone had ever done it.
And it was why I was that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and the bright future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went from New York, and I would leave my job of my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I was going to quit my job and <unk> and I went together from Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> which was getting out of head into a financial trap financial trap carefully ready.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat to violence to see how it reacts to.
And this is where those <unk> come in.
As soon as we moved to New England we already know, that place where <unk> had to be so sure she bought three <unk>
One had the car <unk>
Another drops underneath the pillow in our bed and the third person in his pocket.
And he said he needed those guns out of the trauma that they were <unk>
I needed them to feel secure.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and although I had never lifted my hands, my life was already serious danger, every minute of every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning, and I still had <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 <unk> of my neck my neck had disappeared, I put my mother's <unk> and married him.
In spite of what there was happened, I was sure that I was living happily forever, because I loved her and he wanted to be very much.
And I was very, very <unk>
There was just a lot of <unk> for the wedding, and by the fact to form a family with me.
I had been an isolated accident, and I never would do harm.
I spent two times more on our moon of honey.
The first time I was driving into a secret beach and <unk> me and he gave me so hard in my head that <unk> various times against the <unk> of the car.
And then a couple of days later, driving around our moon of honey, he <unk> through the traffic and threw the Big Mac to the face.
<unk> kept <unk> or two times a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was thrilled when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One in three American women is the victim of domestic violence or <unk> at some point in their life, and the Centers for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had very good company.
Going back to my question, why am I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman, in love of a profoundly <unk> man and was the only person in the world who could help <unk> to confront their <unk>
The other question that everybody does is, why don't it just be <unk>
Why don't I <unk> I could have stayed at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and agonizing question that people do, because we are the victims, we know the victims, we know something that normally you <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase of the <unk> of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the murder in cases of domestic violence occur after the victim finally <unk> the relationship, after <unk> because then <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> gone back to <unk> <unk> from financial resources, and manipulation of the family court system for <unk> to the victim and their children, who normally are forced by judges to spend time not <unk> with the man who would raise her mother.
And we still keep asking why why they're not supposed to go?
I was able to go, because of one last <unk> down that beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if he would have allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told everybody, the police, to the police, to my friends, my friends, full unknown, and I'm here today because you all love me.
We have the tendency to <unk> the victims as the <unk> <unk> women <unk> goods.
The question, "Why do you <unk>
And for some people it's a way to say "The guilt is it by <unk> as if <unk> victims are charged with men who want to <unk>
But since I posted <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who were also <unk> who learned a trusted <unk> of what happened to them and that they would spend their lives joyful and happy lives like <unk> wives and mothers, life completely free of violence like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor of domestic domestic domestic violence.
I became marrying a cute cute guy, and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to do to have before, I would never, ever be a broken gun pointing to my head in the hands of someone who says I want.
Right now, they're thinking, "Wow, that is <unk> or <unk> what stupid <unk> but all of this time I've been talking about you.
I assure you there's a few people that are listening to me right now, that they're being <unk> or that they are being <unk> they are themselves.
The <unk> could be affecting his daughter, her sister, her best friend right now.
I was able to put my crazy love, a particular love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request for you.
Talk to what you've heard here.
The abuse is only in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence simply by shedding light on it.
The victims need the whole world.
We need each of you understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They would take the <unk> to light talking about it with your children, their fellow jobs, their friends and family.
<unk> their vision of survivors as fantastic and <unk> and <unk> future <unk>
<unk> the computer signs of violence to intervene consciously, to stop their climb and show the victims safe <unk>
And together we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the <unk> and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hi. I call this Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be precise, for 10 years.
And I feel that at this point, there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have fallen dressed like this.  Luckily, I've brought her <unk> clothes.
This is the first change of clothing on a stage of <unk> so you have a lot of luck in it, I think.
If some of the women were <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to be <unk> now, but I'll find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These <unk> are very <unk> less than I don't have to.
The worst part is going through this <unk> because it's when you're going to make fun of me, so you don't do anything as the head covers me.
All right.
Why did I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but it's also <unk>
I have totally changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, there was never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and photographer and the photographer said to me that I would raise her back and get the hair out of the guy.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial <unk> like the one I made two days ago to work -- there's very little that we could do to transform our looks, which, although shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my workforce, that's to be a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say, <unk> I discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of a <unk> and you might be wondering what this <unk>
Well, in the last few centuries, we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which we are biologically wired for <unk> we've also associated with a high and <unk> shape, and to a white skin.
And that's my <unk> <unk> that I've known to take for money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who now show up, and maybe there's some of you who are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> for knowing so much about models.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York counted all and every single models in <unk> and <unk> models -- only <unk> -- is less than four percent, they were not white <unk>
The next question that people always ask me is: Can I be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't get the interest of that.
But then, what I would really tell you every one of these girls is: Why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon will be <unk> <unk> and poet, which would be awesome, because you'd be the first one.
If after this private list, I still <unk> no, no, yeah, I want to be a model, then I tell you, I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the chief of the <unk> of the American journal or the CEO of <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you want to be a model to say that you want to win the lottery when you're older.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you all about what I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike <unk> surgery, can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you get out of your studies, and you have a set of jobs and a few jobs on your back, whether you think about what <unk> is to say, if you think that you want to be president of the United States, but you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you have a <unk> Model <unk> for 10 years, people would be weird.
The next question that people always ask me is if all of the photos are <unk>
And yes, virtually all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my time yet.
I know we're getting into the personal domain, but it was a child.
And so I started my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are from the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a Christmas party a few days before the French French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize I'm not me in those pictures.
They are <unk> from a professional <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and they can create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is: <unk> things for free?
I have too many <unk> <unk> and I never use, except the first couple of them, but the privilege I get is the ones I get in the real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a store and I forgot to get money, and they gave me the <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped on a red <unk> and, of course, we <unk> and I <unk> I'm sorry, an agent to be able to keep <unk>
<unk> of these <unk> for me looks, not for what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their way they don't matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, from the teenage <unk> and <unk> 86 percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino and Latino people in New York, so for them, it's not a matter of <unk>
I think about how many times I <unk>
And when I look for this talk, I learned that at 53 percent of <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes to 78 percent to 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer that you expect is, if you're a little bit thinner and you have the most brilliant hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe that would be.
<unk> It's really wonderful to go, and also incredible to work with creative and <unk> and <unk>
And all of that is true, but it's just one part of what happens, because what we never call in front of the cameras, what I have never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my mind every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, <unk> little legs and the brighter hair will be happier?
They only have to gather with a group of models, because they have the <unk> legs, the brightest hair and the <unk> but probably be the most insecure women on the planet.
But mostly it was hard to look at a situation of racial and racial and gender and I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something that we hold out of this talk, I hope that everybody will feel more comfortable than to recognize the power of the image of perception that we have about success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was enough enough to hold a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 more <unk> photos and I wasn't the <unk>
There were no CEOs or <unk> no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a minimum amount of <unk>
In fact, most of them took them tourists at random.
My story begins in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of <unk> and <unk>
He happened that we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to pull the same picture.
Well, you imagine what comes now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife said to me, why don't you take you back to New York on a <unk> journey, and you continue to <unk>
So here is when we started asking the tourists that happened to get us the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has never been denied and, fortunately, no one has ever been <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred to us.
This photo is a few weeks after <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day was that I had five years that I could understand it.
These pictures are much more than representations of a concrete moment or a specific journey.
It's also a way to stop time in a week of October and to make us reflect on our age and our evolution over the years, not only at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, even though we always got the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter has new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how they perceive and interact with everything.
That particular time that we spend together is something that we hope with illusion every year.
So recently, in one of the travel, we were walking walking, when suddenly he stopped in the dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the <unk> shop that would stop little at previous <unk>
And he described to me what there was a sense of five years in that same place.
They had to remember their heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what he looks at in New York is universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And I suddenly understood that one of the most important things we create is memories.
So, I want to share the idea of actively engaging in the conscious creation.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always taking the picture.
So today, I want to encourage you all to appear in the picture, and you don't get to go close to someone and asked, does it take a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
The <unk> are in the <unk> group.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It also has been associated with Disney laughs, and it was a stupid <unk>
More recently, if you've been following the press, laughter, laughter, and <unk> these are the attributes that they associate with the Afghan Parliament. But I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep clean the environment.  <unk> will not help prevent disease <unk>
<unk> are <unk>   You're far from <unk>  And my favorite, <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There's the <unk> of the New World -- mostly in <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> where we have 16 species of these 16, 11 very high risk of extinction.
So why are they <unk> they are important, first of all, provide humanitarian ecological services <unk>
They are <unk>
They <unk> the carcasses to the bone.
They help killing all of the bacteria they help to absorb the anthrax that they were not going to be <unk> and caused huge loss of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> people take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge important importance.
They've been associated with ancient <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of the <unk> and the finger, and along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the <unk> and the Underground Egypt.
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and he risked his life to save the <unk> goddess of 10 heads.
In <unk> culture, these are very important <unk> to open sky in places like Tibet, there's nowhere to bury the dead, or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural elimination system.
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, of which six are at the end of which six are in the extreme end of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and the <unk> <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a consequence, <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are in the <unk> critical list of <unk> which means that in less than 10 or 15 years, and the reason is because they fall prey out of <unk> consumption that has been treated with a drug <unk> like <unk>
This drug has been banned from the veterinarian in India and they've taken a statement.
Since there is no <unk> there's been a spread in the number of <unk> dogs in the ground, and when you have <unk> dogs -- you have a huge bomb bomb, and the number of cases has risen enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind wind in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be above the top of Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind, but we have to work with governments, because the wind turbines do this to the birds. The <unk> <unk>
These are <unk> of birds.
In Western Africa, there is a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve <unk> and the market market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're investigating these birds. We are <unk>
We're trying to determine the basic ecology and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so focused on a living problem is not going to do anything.
We need to work with governments at the <unk> levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and services that are <unk>
How can you help? It can become assets, and can make noise, you can write a letter to your government and tell you, we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you get out of this room, you will tell you about the <unk> but talk to your families, with your sons, with their neighbors about the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed his opinion, because he saw them flying without effort, no energy cost in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much bigger without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> young people, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Cote <unk> <unk> and Somalia. In government projects with African countries.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
<unk> the 21, which Italians were good people and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of all I <unk> what we <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> of <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided we decided to teach people from country to grow food.
So we got with seeds -- <unk> south of <unk> to this absolutely wonderful valley drops to the <unk> River, and we teach the local growing tomatoes and Italians and <unk> and so on.
And of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, because of what they were excited to come to work, and sometimes they did not survive.  We were complaining that the local people in that fertile valley, never had any agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we didn't do anything, we just said, "Thank God that we are here --  <unk> for time to save the people in <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa grew <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato odor would grow in this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were saying to the <unk> "Look how easy it is <unk>
When the tomatoes were cute <unk> and red at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> "My God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, so we don't have agriculture here --  "Why don't you have <unk>
I thought we only Italians did errors in Africa, but then, I saw what the Americans, did what the <unk> did, which they were doing and then see what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, you see, at least we feed the <unk>
<unk> look at the <unk>  So let's see the waste that we gave them to the <unk> people in Africa.
He wants to read a book, reading <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors have given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I don't tell you about the damage that the money has <unk>
Just read your book.
It's part of an African woman, the harm we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> Carrie <unk> and we treat people just two ways: or the <unk> or are we <unk>
The two words come from the <unk> <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
<unk> I try to try to do any of a different culture like my children, "I want you a lot."
<unk> I try all of a different culture as if they were <unk>
So white in Africa are called <unk> <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face of the face, the small thing is <unk> written by <unk> who said for all economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk>
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the guy who opened this conference put a cane on the ground and said, we can just imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided in the age of the age of the only to <unk> and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you ever <unk> anything, you will never give anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream to become a better person.
So what do you do? Do you <unk>
Never come to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from the offices.
And we met at a cafe. We met them in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important is passion.
You can give an idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what's going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important.
The passion that that man has for its own personal growth is the most important.
And then we help them find knowledge because no one in the world can be successful.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years ago, and years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, once instead of getting into a community to tell people what to do, for once, but not in our community meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs will never come up, and they would never tell you in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what a chance have <unk>
So, planning has this blind.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know the know because they don't take their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face -- you have to create social infrastructure -- which doesn't exist.
You should create a new profession.
The profession is a family physician from the company, the family physician in the business -- which is ready with you at home, at the table of her kitchen table, and it helps you find the resources to transform their passion in a way of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of West Africa.
I was doing a Ph.D. at the time, trying to get away from this junk junk that we get to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects on a year, and the government came to see to ask, "How can you do that?
How do you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very difficult.
I was shocked, and I would love you.  So the government says, "Welcome <unk>  So we've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of <unk>
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business advisers in history, died '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy, before they engaged in business, and this is what Peter <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
<unk> is the kiss of the <unk> of business <unk>
So now <unk> <unk> <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to talk to you.
You have to offer you, privacy, it has to be fantastic to the <unk> and then <unk> will come in the <unk>
In a community of <unk> we get 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What do you show you is <unk>
<unk> <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the <unk> spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution <unk> fossil <unk> <unk> and from one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way to sustain <unk> is not sustainable.
What we need to consider, is how <unk> <unk> <unk> -- to communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green Revolution, <unk> <unk>
government?
They will be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's an amazing story that I read in a magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in <unk>
And in the year I was brought together this group of people, and they would figure out what happened to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City wouldn't exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population keeps growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million <unk> and the manure produced by six million <unk> would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in <unk>  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> life of New York.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years in 1900, in the United States of the United States has been <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan.
However, there is a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise they're not going to talk to you.
Then, you have to offer an absolute, dedicated <unk>
And then later you have to tell you about it with <unk>
The smallest company, the bigger company, the bigger company has to be able to do three things -- the product you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to tell a fantastic marketing and you have to tell you with a great financial administration.
Do you know what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that can do, to sell and look for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've looked at the 100 thousand modern companies in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all the new companies, <unk> <unk>
There is only one thing that all of the successful companies in the world have in common, just one: no one was started by one person.
I don't love the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he started.
Nobody starts an ACE company.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment, in <unk> with their dedicated <unk> who will do for you, what someone did for this gentleman who speaks about this <unk> someone who speaks to this <unk> someone who is asking you, what do you need?
What can you? You can do it?
Well, you can <unk> You can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." Tell you to watch you <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those of us can help us from many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't make a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
In the past few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> and <unk> and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much people pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and ask for more things without calling the door on a bad moment?
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understanding our <unk>
How do you share more our hopes for cows so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New York, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the <unk> giant <unk> shading of <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It always gives birth to the music.  There's a <unk> in New York  The city has one of the most beautiful products in the world, but also one with the most beautiful <unk> of the U.S.
I live close to this house and thought about how it could turn it into a rather nice space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
Their death was sudden and he was unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and death.
And this was a profound gratitude for the life of time.
He gave the most significant things about my life today.
But let's stop keeping this look in my daily life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be catching up day and to forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant board and painted on her sentences for <unk> <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and sharing personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled and still <unk>
And I'd like to share a few things that people wrote on the wall.
Before she died, I want to be judged by <unk>  "Before I die. I want to sit on <unk> on the line of <unk>
Before she died, I want to sing for millions of people."
"Before he died, I want to plant a <unk>
Before she died, I want to live outside <unk>
"Before he died, I want <unk> once more."
"Before he died, I want to go to the rescue rescue.
"Before he died, I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hopes of people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me solace in tough times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways new and <unk> it's about giving us the reflection and <unk> and remembering what is most important to us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
And so with my colleagues at the civic center we made a kit and now have been <unk> in countries around the world, like South Africa, Australia, Argentina, and beyond.
And together we showed the power of our public spaces if they give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of fertilizers, they increase, it is more important than ever, to find the ways of preserving the perspective and remembering that life is very short and fragile.
The death is something that we often avoid talking about -- or even thinking, but I understood that we prepare for death is one of those things that give us more power.
He's going to think about death, death <unk> our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what we care about as individuals and as a community and more media to share hope, fears and stories, the people around us cannot help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce my siblings.
<unk> has 22 years old, and it's very hot.
No speech, but it gives joy better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
<unk> <unk> happen what happens.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't matter the religious differences and notice about this: has never been <unk>
When you singing songs of our childhood, trying to tell the words that I didn't even say -- it reminds me of one thing: the little thing we know about the mind and how wonderful it should be the unknown.
Samuel She's 16 years old. He's very hot.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but remember the year I came up with each of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, they would stand in my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady <unk>
It doesn't seem <unk>
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because your minds don't fit into the concept of <unk> which are often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if you wouldn't consider it inside the <unk> that could only mean one thing: which were <unk> and extraordinary and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes physical skills.
In every individual it manifests itself in a different way, which is so different from Sam.
And around the world, every 20 minutes, will be diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the developing disorders of the development in the world, there is no cause or cure <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I was only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self going to be in my life.
When I spent a few months, I realized he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies, and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
He lived in their own world, with their own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting cars around the room around the room, looking at the washing machine, and eat anything that would have <unk>
As I was growing up, it would go more different, and the differences became more apparent.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature and innocent and a child that looked at the world with no <unk> a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there's been some difficult moments in my family, moments I wish they were just like me.
But I look back to the things that have taught me about <unk> communication and love, and I realize that they are things that wouldn't want to change by normal.
<unk> passes through the beauty that give us the differences and actually be different doesn't mean that one is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what is right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and Sam and to you, would you have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, <unk> or not, the differences you <unk> are a <unk> each one of us has a gift on their interior and honestly, the pursuit of normal is the last sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change dies at the moment in which we are trying to be like others.
Please please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit what has been to be <unk> in the course of <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a teacher of communications, who gave a kind of communication to graduate engineering.
I was scared.  <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of these students with their big minds, their big books and their big <unk> words.
But when those conversations were built, I felt what was going on, it must have felt that when it fell down the <unk> hole and saw the door to a new world.
So I felt when I had these conversations with the students. I was surprised by the ideas I had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a big communication.
We really need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our larger challenges from energy to <unk> and health care, among others, and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers don't invite us to see their wonderful world.
So scientists, and engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure we can see their science is sexy and that its engineering is obvious.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
They don't tell us just to study the <unk> but they study the <unk> which are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat it.
And when you're describing your science, care with <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle to our understanding of your ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't you say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing that makes them dumb
Instead, like Einstein, said that everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without engaging ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies are ways of <unk> and <unk> with their content.
And when you do this work, forget the signs of <unk>
Have you wondered why they call <unk>  What do the <unk> <unk> kill, and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it supports too much in the area of the language of our brain and we are <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the unique design of the <unk>
So the trick here is to use a simple <unk> <unk> that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then you can provide graphs that will address our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what it is about.
I think these are just some key ones that can help everyone open the door and look at the country of wonders which is science and engineering.
And so scientists, and engineers, when you've solved this equation, through all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words of the entire OED.
Just because it sounds pretty good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor of the 19th century that was much better when he said, <unk> <unk> is the one that aims for a public charge or no matter -- or principle, and that, when they won, it gets the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something to do with the words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to quote the exact words that they were told in the <unk> chamber.
And all of this was thanks to the courage of a guy with the <unk> name, <unk> who was confronted by <unk>
They put them in the Tower of London and <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end he had such a popular support in London I won.
And just a few years later, we had the first use recorded of the phrase called <unk> <unk> as well as the <unk>
Most people think it's <unk>
It's not. It's an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you how words and politics interact, I want you back to the U.S., just after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington and their leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call it a <unk> leader.
This was <unk> in Congress for a long time.
There were all kinds of suggestions that might have been <unk>
Some of them wanted to call him <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> of the world's <unk> <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them simply wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was <unk>
And not even with that were <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a fixed picture.
And I could have <unk>
The whole world got tired and <unk> because this debate was happening for three weeks.
And he was a daily journal, and I always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
Which caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want to be <unk>
They didn't want to call it a King for whether it would give him to him or your <unk> ideas.
So they wanted to give him the most <unk> and more attractive title that it came to you.
And that title was <unk>
President. You didn't invent the title. There was no before, but it only meant <unk> that <unk> a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And it wasn't much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> but it was really a <unk>
And so the Senate <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign <unk> and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will take a serious title with a <unk> and <unk> <unk> as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate not <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite of my favorite until I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been seen as the title of President.
The President Barack Obama is lucky to follow up there, waiting for the Senate in action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government tells you that one measure is <unk>  <unk> we may go for <unk>
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and this is the most important thing, and this is that the president of President of the United States doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads and the largest economy of the world and a fleet of flying vehicles and so on.
The reality and the story has <unk>
So at the end I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern about the Senate, appearance appearance -- well, it was a uniqueness for the time.
But you know how many nations are now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So, at the end the Senate won and the House of Representatives <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them you're now the President of <unk>
And I think that's the big lesson we can learn, and that I would like to <unk>
Political politicians try to choose and use words to shape and control the reality, but actually actually change the fact that much more the words that they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 feet underground.
The air is warm and dust, and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of body bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk about but, above all, that cacophony of <unk> <unk> and stones with primitive.
Like each other -- I carry a cheap <unk> of light <unk> he held into the head with this <unk> <unk> and I barely can distinguish the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole from a meter that goes up hundreds of feet on Earth.
And my hand and all of a sudden I remember a <unk> that I met before he lost the control and fell to a <unk> feet in that body.
As I talk to you today, these guys are deep in the deep end of that hole and their lives without pay, and often, dying.
I went out of that hole, and I went home, but they probably never will.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 continents on six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the Peace <unk>
Among all the amazing people that I met there met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> a NGO who is dedicated to <unk> modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and actually, I started learning about slavery because I knew there was the world but not to such a degree.
When we finished talking to me I felt really nasty <unk> and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me a <unk> and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and I offer my help.
It started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
Some of them even, I considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice as much as the number of Africans displaced throughout the entire <unk> slave <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer farmer was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 people today.
However, today, you can be attributed to entire families for generations by adding 18 million 18.
Amazingly, slavery is generating revenues over over 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with fake promise of good education, better work to then find that they're forced to work without pay, under violence and they can't escape.
Today, slavery operates in <unk> the goods produced by slaves to <unk> but who produce them are color.
slavery exists in most of the world, and yet it is illegal throughout the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange show and <unk> was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of 54 C. men, women, in fact, families -- entire families -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> bricks in their heads, until 18 at the same time, and they take them from <unk> furnaces to trucks that are hundreds of feet.
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task again and again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no <unk> no way to drink, and the severe <unk> I would make it pee rather <unk>
They were so <unk> they were the heat and dust that my camera got too warm to touch and left working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean the car and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side and he said to me, <unk> don't do it here."
And it explained to me very clearly to prove emotions very dangerous in places like this one, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, anything.
I was not <unk> of that country.
I could put them in a worse situation than they were already gone.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and work within the system because of her release and trusted that you will.
As I waited for me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found these kids <unk> stones for miles per mile per <unk> to trucks that were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were much more heavy than the kids that were exposed to their head and the children were <unk> their heads with <unk> <unk> made of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something that <unk>
How can we influence such <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all his life.
Do you have nothing to be <unk>
When these <unk> <unk> their freedom, <unk> they have completely <unk>
When you hear the word slavery often we think of sexual trafficking, and because of this global awareness of me told me that it would be difficult for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was diagnosed with women who had been previously previously <unk>
It was led to me by some stairs <unk> that would give this dirty <unk> of faint light <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was rather a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, they are local for prostitution <unk>
They have small rooms -- private rooms where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of that only seven -- they're forced to get to the clients and to encourage them to buy more food and alcohol.
Each is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse to their clients.
On the <unk> I remember a fear of <unk> <unk> and, in that moment, I barely could imagine what it must be caught in that <unk>
I just had a <unk> the steps where I <unk>
There was no <unk> doors.
There was no big windows like <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and we touch a topic that hard, is important to point that slavery even sexual trafficking, is happening around us.
There are hundreds of <unk> people in agriculture, in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
So recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold every year as a sex child.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that we often associate with labor <unk>
I went to my Indian villages in which there were entire families packed in the <unk> trade.
This is a family professor.
The white hands of black is the father of blue and <unk> of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> the silk in the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me his stories.
"We have no <unk> they said.
We have no hope yet to get out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are over 4,000 children in the <unk> <unk> the biggest lake in the world.
When we arrived, I was going to take a quick look.
I saw what it looked like to be a female family on a boat, two old brothers, some younger children, a few younger children.
<unk> They were all <unk>
Kids are separated from their families and <unk> and they were forced to work <unk> in these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came to the <unk> he was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling water.
The branches of the trees in <unk> the branches of trees in Lake <unk> often will catch networks and children, <unk> and <unk> is thrown into the water to unlock the branches.
A lot of it <unk>
Since <unk> has always been forced to work in the lake.
Because of fear of her love is not going to flee and as the whole life has been treated with cruelty, it's about the youngest <unk> under their command.
I met these guys in the five in the morning, when they were born, the last networks, but they had been working on our own.
It was cold and <unk>
And I can point that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're filled with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a shelter where he <unk> the <unk> <unk> the victims of slavery.
Kofi <unk>
Who will come because of somebody decided to make a difference in your life?
He took for a road in Ghana with <unk> partners, the <unk> a fellow <unk> with her <unk> suddenly accelerated and <unk> our car and played the window.
It was asked to do it by a land path to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we were going to come out of the car, and asked him to the driver that would go quickly.
And then pointed at this path barely visible and said, "This is the way, this is the road.
As we started to go down, we took off the <unk> that would take the way back and then to walk around an hour and found that the way I was <unk> over the recent <unk> so I put the photographs of photos on my head as I was walking around in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> road ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had in front of a mass holes that could fit in a soccer camp -- and they were all filled with <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children strapped on their backs and, as they were looking for gold <unk> <unk> in the waters with <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These <unk> are <unk> in a pit in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the well they were <unk> in their own <unk>
I remember looking at his naked eyes very tired, because many had been underground for 72 hours.
<unk> have even 90 feet and these people carry <unk> heavy bags that then will be transported to another area where they put the stone to power the gold.
To the first view, the site seems to be full of strong men and <unk> but if we look closer to close, at the edge we see at the same other and fewer and children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> ended up like this victim of T.B. and <unk> for <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, he took him to work with him in mines.
When he died their uncle, <unk> gave it the debt of the uncle to be the force in the mines.
When I met him, he had been working in the 14 and the injury of the leg that you see here is a product of a crash in the <unk> so momentous doctors said that I had to be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has T.B. and yet, at that, he's forced to work at night and day in that mine.
Still, he dream with being released and educated with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, from face to a remote, which inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to throw a light on slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen by you around the world.
I wanted you to know that we will be witness to them and we will do everything that we can to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see ourselves a few other as human beings, then they make it really difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from patience -- these are people, real people, like you, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that I think I don't think of these so many beautiful, beautiful people, that I've had the great honor to know.
I hope that these images show a force in which you see, in people like you, and I hope that force turn on a fire, and that fire <unk> light over slavery because, without that light, the <unk> of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I make a mathematical problem and there's a particular problem for anyone who <unk> we are like <unk>
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I am going to try to explain to you what I do.
<unk> is one of the most human activities.
We get rid of the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> dancers -- that we'll see further ahead.
But the teacher demand a level of extraordinary training -- a high level of dexterity and probably a kind of initial <unk> that might well have a genetic component.
Sadly, the neurologic disorders like Parkinson's disease -- in addition to this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at his time, was a <unk> <unk>
In the last few years has moved much into treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> stiffness and other symptoms of this disease, so we need <unk> tools to detect disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure the progress of objective in order and ultimately the only way we will know if there's really a cure to be when we have an objective metric and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement is not <unk> and so they don't use blood and the best we have is a neurological <unk> of 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that outside of the clinical trials are never done.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic -- what if patients could do the exam test.
You don't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to suggest, as a conventional way to make a try, you can see, you can see it in a sense at least, we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration from the <unk>
It shows someone healthy as it makes sounds like this, and we can imagine that as an dancers of a <unk> <unk> because we have to coordinate all these vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the genes required.
And as a result, it requires an extraordinary training level.
Let's think about time that leads to a child to learn to speak.
From the sound, we can track the position of vocal cords as it comes out, and as well as Parkinson's affects the <unk> it also affects the organs.
On the bottom plot you can see an example of <unk> <unk> of the vibrating <unk>
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and puzzled after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests in the voice with the clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
<unk> IQ is not <unk> Both use existing infrastructure.
Needless to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
They both are <unk> OK, but in addition to <unk> tests are not <unk>
I mean, you can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds a lot.
They're <unk> and we all know what happens to happen.
When something takes a <unk> cost it appears to massive scale.
These are some amazing goals to address.
We can reduce their patient <unk>
I would not have to go to the clinic to routine.
Eventually, we could get goals.
We could make <unk> mass cost for clinical trials, and, for the first time, <unk> <unk> at a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So by doing today the first steps in that sense, we're launching the <unk> <unk>
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and begin to address these targets.
We have local lines accessible to about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with <unk> I can call it under price and <unk> and I'll announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So let me take all these samples of, let's say 10,000 people, you can say who's healthy and who doesn't?
What do you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not, you are not the disease.
<unk> You see, some people may not <unk> You can't afford it.
But we're going to get a very big sample of data that's <unk> in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances, it's important because we're looking for <unk> the factors factors looking for the real markers of disease.
TR: You've got a <unk> of accuracy at this moment?
<unk> A lot more than that.
In fact, my graduate student, I have to <unk> has made a fantastic job and now has shown that it works in the mobile phone grid, too, what you would take on the project.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before <unk> 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures, gray.
We were focusing on the dark, in armed rooms and large, we avoid sunlight.
We do the exact models that even more <unk> the perfect skin is still more perfect -- we can use it in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talents with many years of experience and a real taste for images and photography.
On April 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
Shortly after that, an organization where it was <unk> <unk> <unk> was in the room working as part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't be sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On the 13th of May I traveled to <unk>
It's a little <unk> people located in the <unk> of nearly 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the wave.
The level of water recorded over 24 feet tall and more than three kilometers up.
As you can imagine, the people was <unk>
<unk> rubble from channels and <unk>
<unk> schools, removed the mud and we leave the houses to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons of tons and tons of fish -- <unk> <unk> from local <unk>
We were <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, both the volunteers like the neighbors found similar things like this.
They found pictures and photos of photos and cameras and cards.
They all did the same thing.
<unk> and bring them to different places of the villages around me.
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represent a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
While they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon anything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped clean the toilets, the enormous, giant <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor that that day would come up on me to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, had heard of the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I get away my horizons that something happened.
By looking at the pictures, I found some that had more than a hundred years of a few people still in the lab, and I couldn't help think of how to <unk> how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I walked on Facebook contacted with some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive and that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
I wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had to <unk> it with a lot of precision and <unk>
Otherwise that little girl wouldn't have the aspect of it, and that would be as tragic as you have the photo.
Over the course of the time, they got for a little bit more photos, and they need more <unk> so it came back in Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries volunteered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we moved to <unk> a <unk> town north of <unk>
Once in the week we use our scanner in the modern standard libraries that had <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time I <unk> in <unk> is a different story: depended on the <unk> of the photos.
It could take an hour, it could take a few weeks.
It could be <unk>
This <unk> had to draw practically hand using the areas of which color and the detail of the water had not been destroyed.
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures <unk> in <unk> water covered in bacteria, and even with oil, all of it together with the passage of time continue to <unk> for that <unk> hand was a major part of the project.
We couldn't afford the picture unless they were clean, dry and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky with the <unk>
We tell the guidance of a <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more the photos already <unk>
As a <unk> once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman that brought us these pictures were lucky to the photos.
He had started <unk> her, but he stopped when he realizes that <unk> even more.
He also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and her own face would not have been able to reconstruct it, we were able to filter it into one photo and looked at the whole picture.
When they collected their photographs shared some of his story with us.
A few colleagues of her husband found the photos on a fire station between the rubble, quite far from where they used to be his house, but his colleagues <unk>
On the day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
It had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
His little child, not so small now, but their two children were in school in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
He took a week to find his whole family and know that everybody had survived.
The day he gave her photographs her son under 14 years later.
To her, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift that he could ever remember <unk> something that I could remember from the past that had not been marked on the past day when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there -- hundreds of them helped us to clean up more of <unk> pictures -- the big <unk> -- the vast majority turned to their hands of their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us to return to 90 families and hundreds of them completely <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we don't spend over 1,000 dollars in teams and materials, most of them in ink for <unk>
We took pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, a relationship, someone wanted.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing we would take us to look for.
This is about the project to restore little pieces of humanity, to return to someone their connection to the past.
When a picture like this one comes back to somebody, it's a huge difference in the life of the person that receives it.
This project also made a huge difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected to something bigger -- to bring something larger, using your talent to something that they are not <unk> <unk>
So to conclude, I'd like to read this email -- I sent it up the day I came from Japan after six months.
As <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a photo with women from the grandmother to the little girl and gathering around a baby, and I was shocked, because a very similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, and my <unk> daughter hangs off our wall.
In the whole world, in all the few times our basic needs, right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us awe and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple in an exhibition just one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not to a million or a billion frames per second.
Let me introduce you to a new kind of <unk> the <unk> a new technique that can make videos on the speed of light.
And with that we can create cameras that you can see after the <unk> of vision, or see the interior of the body without using X-rays, and they defy really the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and it turned it into a <unk> of a second or so, in many ways, create a <unk> package of just a millimeter of <unk>
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel to the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a common bullet than a common bullet does.
If we take that bullet and this pack of photons and stick it into this bottle, how do they spread through this <unk>
What's the aspect of light in the camera <unk>
Now, all of this --  -- remember, this is actually happening in less than a <unk> that's what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so that you can see light in motion.
Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola don't <unk> this research   <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> comes into the bottle with a stack of photons that starts <unk> and that, inside, start <unk>
Part of the light's <unk> goes to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons actually arrive at the lid and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's an air bubble that bounces on inside the inside.
In that time, the waves travel down the table and because of the <unk> of the top you see it in the bottom of the bottle, after a number of boxes, all the <unk> <unk>
Now, if we take a common bullet and the current and we make it go down the same distance and you see it slow to about 10 billion times, how much do you think it would lead us to look at that film?
One <unk> One week? In fact, every single year.
It would be a very boring film, a slow bullet in motion.
And how about it about <unk>
You can see the waves coming from the table and the tomato wall.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, he was thinking about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full test.
But if you look at the more time, you will realize that, as the light comes out of the <unk> in the <unk> you don't get bright.
Why? Because the tomato bomber is <unk> and the light bounces up into its interior and goes back after a number of <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your cellphone, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and verify if the fruit is mature without having to <unk>
So what do we create this camera at all?
As the photographers, you know, if you take a look at the low exposure, it comes very little light up.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the shortest <unk> so you barely get some light.
We sent that <unk> that <unk> and millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those data from data and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data into crude and <unk> in a interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes may become invisible,
And if a new power of a <unk> future, would you see after the <unk>
So the idea is that we could throw some light on the door. Let's go into the room, one part is going to reflect on the gate, and from there to the camera.
Where we could extract those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. We have built.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall there is a dummy and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will come back into the camera but interestingly, at some slightly different time.
And as we have a camera that works so fast, our <unk> has unique <unk>
It's got very good time resolution, and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances down to the door and also even the hidden objects but we don't know what point corresponds to which distance.
By projecting a laser can record a picture in gross, which you see on the screen, really doesn't make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, tens of images, the <unk> and we'll try and analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we'll be able to see the symmetrical object.
Can you see it <unk>
This is our institute.
We have things like to explore before we pull this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what's going around the curve, the curve.
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions, looking at the light reflected by open windows.
Or we could build <unk> that we can see the interior of the body through <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of the fabric and blood is quite hard, so this is actually a request to scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new presence of visualization to solve the problems of the next generation.
So like <unk> <unk> he was a scientist, it became science art, art of photography <unk>
I realized that all of the data we collected every single data we collected is not just for scientific <unk> but we can do it.
Making a new form of computer photography with a slow camera and <unk>
And look at those waves, you know, the time between each of those waves is just a few <unk> of a second.
But here's a fun thing here.
If you look at the waves underneath the <unk> these are <unk>
<unk> should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, like we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have weird effects.
The order in which events occur in the world are sometimes <unk>
<unk> the corresponding warping of space and time, we can fix this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hi. This is my cell phone.
A mobile phone, your life, and gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone, a crime is <unk> against humanity in Syria.
You can tweet a message and initiate a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone, you can record a song, and it would get it famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and I live in the city of <unk>
So let's go back to that moment to this town.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are <unk> in search of change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people were gathering that <unk> looking for a change, they had a mobile <unk>
Who in the party have a phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phone.
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot of a lot of a cell today.
But today I'm going to talk about my mobile, and how life changed me.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> information lines.
Amazing.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the <unk> Commission introduced a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
And this directive says that every European company, every single single Internet provider has to store a wide range of users of users.
Who's called <unk> Who calls an email to who.
Who sends a text to who.
And if we use your phone, where we are.
All this information is stored for at least six months, and until two years, in your phone company, or your Internet <unk>
And in all Europe people planted and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this retention of data.
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the carriers and the Internet <unk> all this information on us.
There was lawyers, journalists, priests, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see a few thousand people who came to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> don't <unk>
And some of them even said this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police of Eastern Germany.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information on us?
Every time you use your <unk>
So I asked my phone phone, <unk> <unk> that in that time, I was the largest telephone company in Germany, who please get me through the whole information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to wonder, and I didn't get a concrete answer. It was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to give you a lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we won't give you this information.
At the end, they agreed.
It would send me the demand and they would send me the information I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly on brown with a CD inside.
And on the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand dollars -- 30 billion information.
At first I saw them and I said, well, it's a huge file, OK.
But after a while I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step at night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information <unk>
I want to make <unk>
Because I want to show people what the retention means.
So, next to <unk> <unk> and Open <unk> City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom down and go forward.
You can see every step I want to see.
And you can see how I'm going to be <unk> on the train to <unk> and how often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That's a little scary.
But it's not just about me.
But all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me about a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call it among them.
And then you call the other, and the other one to the other, and we end up with this big communication network.
You can see how your people communicate between each other to what time they call each other, what time they fall in.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what's doing society.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who you talk to whom, who gives an email to who, this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at first, imagine if all these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, had a mobile phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I participated in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, this would never happen.
The fall of the Berlin Wall, probably never happened.
And as a result, neither is the fall of <unk>
Because today, state companies and companies are able to store so much information from us as possible inside and outside the web.
They want to have the possibility of keeping our lives and want to <unk>
But <unk> and living in the digital age, it's not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home to your friends that the privacy is a value of the 21st century and it's not done fashion.
When you go home, you will get your representative of the reason because business and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones that you can remember that they have to fight for <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hello me, what's going on?
Not enough.
Hello me, what's going on?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor who brought me to the world.
<unk> to my mom six times in six different directions <unk> to the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, for that <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I am as a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
<unk> C is not genetics.
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
Nobody <unk> the uterus and not the <unk> because my parents were cousins, and they are.
Only by accidents, like the one that happened to me at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration -- and I don't want any of them here today.
I'm feeling bad for me, because at some point in life, you've chosen to be disabled to be blind.
Let's go <unk>
Christmas Christmas -- they're in the shopping center, and drive in circles and what do you see?
16 places for <unk>
And think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
Moreover, I tell you, I've got the 99 problems, and the P. <unk> is just one of them.
There's a <unk> of the <unk> I earned the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> <unk> woman, who's live and live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, you might have to.
I am in <unk> <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood and my illness had the same initial past.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I can.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, but my parents don't believe in <unk> <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> I do it."
If my three sisters.
If my three older sisters were going to the public school, my parents would go to the school system, and they <unk> that I also went, and if we were not <unk> all the most <unk> <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk at the age of the five years putting my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
Another approach that I used was to hang on a dollar in front of me so that you can get it.
The <unk> that I carry in was very hard and <unk>
Yeah. And the first day in the kindergarten kindergarten was walking like a rubber journal, which has received many <unk>
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my hometown and they were all of the family.
There are now 20 Arabic and they keep all of the family.  I think nobody realized we weren't <unk>
This was before the 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to <unk> as <unk>
The people that I grew up there were no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed like a lot of <unk> a lot to death during the <unk>
I would tell them that I had enough fat to live three months without eat, so let's drop out of the dawn at sunset it's very easy.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Yeah, in <unk> It's crazy. My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to dance.
I learned to dance with <unk> or I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used <unk> myself too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation on the coast of <unk> I was not going.
I spent my summers on a war zone, because my parents feared that if we don't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we were <unk>
On the summer holiday often my father was about <unk> so I drank <unk> milk and I was drinking hot cups on my back, <unk> me in the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water left my eyes and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I must say it's very boring, but before I did yoga was a <unk> comedian that I couldn't stand up <unk> <unk>
And now I can focus on your head.
My parents <unk> this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at <unk> Hospital <unk>
I went to college, through the positive action, and I got a scholarship to the University of the state of Arizona, because I entered all the <unk>
It was like the pet <unk> of theater.
All of me.
I did all the <unk> tasks of the least intelligent, I got the ultimate note in my lectures, and also in their classes.
Every time I was doing a scene from the draglines of <unk> my <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with a cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> <unk> I will have a <unk>
I have learned <unk>
In order to <unk> Al <unk>
Thank God <unk> I am <unk>
I didn't get the role.  They got it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> the director of the theater department, crying out, historically, as if someone had killed my cat, asking for why and she told me because they thought I couldn't do the <unk>
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the <unk> you can't do the <unk>
It was a paper that literally had been born and they gave it to an actor without a brain <unk>
College was mimicking my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> <unk> actors for <unk>
By graduation, I went home, and my first tour, <unk> was as extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew that it would be <unk> to <unk> friend <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> and I didn't see it more than the <unk> and it was evident to me that the <unk> <unk> <unk> not white, white <unk>
Just give perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of these women had one thing in common: They were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
On my first tour, he led famous comics from New York to New Jersey, and I'll never forget the face of the first piece that it took when he landed at the account that I was going to high speed on the highway in New Jersey with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs.
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little piece of rumor that says that women aren't fun, and they find that fun.
In 2003, my brother from another mother, father, Dean <unk> and I launched this <unk> Festival in New York City, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of <unk> in media and time to remind the directors of <unk> that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> to Arabs was much easier to fight the challenge of the disability.
My great opportunity arrived in 2010.
I was invited to join the news program by wire, it has Keith <unk>
I walked up as if I went to a graduate dance, I was invited to a study and they sat on a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, go!
And we were in <unk>
So I clung to the news desk to not go out of the screen on the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
In order I had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they didn't come back to me.
But not only Mr. <unk> returned to <unk> but I had a full-time record and hit my chair.
Something fun I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that the people on the Internet are <unk>
It's said that kids are <unk> but they would never get away from me and no child or no girl.
All of a sudden, my disability became an object of <unk>
<unk> clips in the line with comments like, "Why do I <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite, <unk> <unk> terrorist.
What disease does you have?
We should really pray for her."
A <unk> suggested even I would put my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone in a wheelchair you can't do it <unk> then <unk> can't make someone on a wheelchair.
<unk> are -- yeah, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority in the world, and the most <unk> in the entertainment world.
The doctors were saying that they weren't <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, I have grown up with media, I don't think we <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more images -- that would be less hate to the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we even need the whole society to teach our children.
My journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the infamous <unk> <unk>
I arrived in a film with Adam <unk> and to work with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> have become <unk>
I was <unk> in the big state of New Jersey in <unk> 2008.
And I founded <unk> <unk> an organization for a charity, to give kids Syrian Palestinians uprooted a second part of what my parents would <unk>
It was the only time my father saw me act alive, and I'm doing this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a little boy in a young town.
I don't know her name, but I know your story.
She lives in a little town to the South Wales.
This people are near <unk>
The drought propels the little people to the poverty and the edge of the <unk>
No nothing for him there, it's going to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunities, there are no work, no than any of the future.
He's just living in a tent in the city outside <unk>
After maybe a year ago, nothing.
He's a day about a guy who offered him to take him back to dinner, and he <unk>
It meets a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
She gets a little bit of money to buy <unk> <unk> money to send your family home.
I read a young lady.
Finally went home.
It starts a new life.
It has an objective of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky bursts a bomb.
That little boy in that little village with dreams of the great city was the terrorist terrorist and that dynamic group of people were in the <unk> a terrorist organization connected with al Qaeda.
So how did a story about a little boy in a small village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him.
He was waiting for me.
I was waiting for an opportunity, waiting to start their future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that arrived.
This was the first thing that he pulled out of what we call <unk> <unk>
And their story repeats in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young city that <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity of trying to well-being, but young people are not involved in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often youth that suffer from the highest <unk>
By 2030, three of five people who live in cities are under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't give them opportunities -- the history of the <unk> of <unk> the door of access to terrorism, to violence, to <unk> to be the story of industrialized cities.
And in my hometown, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 doesn't work, it's not going to school.
They do nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit <unk> Hospital the hospital where I was born.
I remember going to that hospital <unk> <unk> thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I had been forced to be on that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure of the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support the youth leaders in a business shop.
<unk> to about 90 youth leaders.
We sat around and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, that because he was a graduate college student, frustrated, was the perfect white man for Al <unk> and other organizations terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest hurdle to get from point A to B are the streets.
<unk> years of civil war, have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
It started <unk> forced to local residents who typically couldn't afford them.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of her family and friends, and her dream is at some point to expand to hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this different story do?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new chance.
It's the business <unk> and I think that business spirit can be the most powerful tool against the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking for so much.
And you can train the youngsters to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the height of corporate business and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business <unk>
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years, and until immediately, until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were plastic sent from the abroad.
If you ask someone, "When was the last time you saw flowers.
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He started a <unk> design company.
He created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he started to grow <unk> and <unk> who said, you could survive the hard <unk> of <unk>
And he started the delivery of flowers for wedding <unk> creating gardens in the houses, and the businesses in the city, and now it's working on the creation of the world's first public park in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where the young families, they can go together, and as he says, smell the pink ones.
By the way, he doesn't grow pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is inspire young people, and in that room, the Easter presence had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought to work for an NGO, to work for government, but their story, their innovation, actually had a strong impact on them.
It forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
The encouraged to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, they could be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So to inspire young people and create a culture of business <unk> is really a great step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and orientation to deal in development and put them in their business.
<unk> young people with the resources they need, <unk> the support that they need to move from conception to creation, and create <unk> to the urban growth.
For me, business spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's creating social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Their <unk> in <unk> is how it's called, when it is created, to transform the way people see their city.
<unk> hired kids from the street to help to rent and keep <unk>
He gave them the opportunity to escape the <unk> of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is: turn the youth in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eating their innovation <unk> and they have more stories about flowers and Parks of Peace that <unk> and <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old and I went to <unk> with my dad in the mountains in the <unk> area in the state of New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun was making the leaves as a <unk> and not going to be the way that we could <unk> we could almost pretend we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We arrived at our camp.
It was a <unk> in a <unk> with a beautiful Lake lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed had a <unk> of about four square meters, with apple beating <unk> balls and <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to pull out what they thought was going to clean up their <unk>
That question she kept with me, and you get a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how to <unk> or where do you choose the <unk> who clean our trash into <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or Paris or <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> clean our garbage, and so 11 tons of waste and two tons of <unk> products every day.
I wanted to know you as individuals.
I wanted to understand who that work does.
What do you feel about using the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and I walked through her <unk> and I interviewed people in office and facilities all over the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to go a little harder.
So I started working as <unk>
Now I wouldn't just travel in the trucks. I was <unk>
And they operated the mechanical <unk> and the <unk>
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
Everybody asks about smell.
It's there, but it's not as popular as you think, and in the days that it's very strong one can be rapidly <unk>
It costs a lot to get the weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years and their bodies kept <unk> the weight of taking their body on their body of garbage all the weeks.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of the Afghan world, the collection of waste is one of the <unk> most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned why.
You're coming out and entering the traffic all day and pass around you.
They just want <unk> so generally the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And the crap itself is full of dangers that often fall out of the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the <unk> of waste.
When you get out of the <unk> you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the trash is like a force of nature itself.
It never keeps coming.
It's also a form of breathing or circulation.
It always must be in motion.
And it's also stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I think strongly that waste waste is the most important work in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste of the waste and effective way every day, this starts to <unk> its <unk> and its dangers inherent in very real ways.
We have used for decades and centuries come up to come up, and they start <unk>
The economics needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old, we don't have room for the way the engines of the economy start to fail when it's in danger of consumption.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just pointed out its relationship.
And then there's what I call our initial average speed we need.
So I mean just at the speed of the <unk> that we used to move on to <unk>
We are usually not <unk> or <unk> we cleaned up or take us with us our cup of coffee, our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use them, we forget about them, we forget about them, because we know there is a job force on the other side that we know about it.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about the collection of waste that maybe help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable city and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when they <unk>
And their work allows us to do ours.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow of the flow that they keep on with us with ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow will always have to stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a plastic collection truck on the street, grabbed my little boy and I went down the stairs and I went down the stairs and there was a man doing his journey of recycled paper as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank her work that particular day, but I started crying.
And I looked at me and simply <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be right."
Shortly after that, I started to research the collection of waste.
It's called <unk> we worked together many times and we did good friends.
I want to believe that it was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts to <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we have to embrace and have to account all the costs, even the real human cost of labor.
<unk> waste that we think when we talk about trash, they represent three percent of the <unk>
It's a remarkable <unk>
So in the flow of your days and their lives, the next one that you see somebody whose work is to clean the trash of you, <unk> a moment for <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you very much.
My work focused on the connection of thinking about our community life, forming part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects as an example of this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the final work of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a <unk> mall in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, to my team and me, about what we needed to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to get <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city -- we realized there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Secondly, you need to employ a lot of energy because the <unk> <unk> generates heat into the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this is not supposed to happen because it's about climate <unk> which is 20 to 25 degrees during the entire year.
And thirdly, his view has nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a death of a place as rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really captivated with the old market that is this <unk> structure where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to small <unk>
There's also this idea of using the public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that was what I really wanted to design, not a mall.
But the question was how to build a New York <unk> building, applying these principles.
The next challenge is presented to implementing the site, which is located in a area of much growth in the city, where much of the buildings that we see in the image, didn't exist.
And it's in addition to two parallel streets that are not communicating in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, bringing all the inputs from the building.
And this spreads with an <unk> <unk> that creates a space to the air in the building, which is <unk> through its own shape, the sun and rain.
And around this space we have applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on every floor because of the space form.
I also thought how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that connects local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar fabric to a concrete <unk> with <unk> to allow the air, and also the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons on the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry and this helped me do the <unk>
We are building that with these little pieces of <unk> that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way to run inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these little color crystals that use light from the inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it did not be easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center.
But ultimately we realized that this idea of the market was going to be much more profitable than the commercial center, because at the end of the mall there were more local to sell.
And then the idea of the facade was so much more <unk> not only because of the material in comparison with glass, but because it was no longer necessary to have air conditioning.
So we get certain savings on the budget we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy energy for the building into a city where electricity is short almost every day.
So we managed to get a big advantage by putting it on the roof.
And then under those panels we think of the roof as a new public space with the <unk> and bars that would create this <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, where they collect water in the inside.
You wait for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to do a big project, the bigger that I have designed, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, and its tradition and culture.
During that analysis I set attention to the <unk> a <unk> structure of <unk> that was surrounded by a wall with a dozen years of access to access to <unk>
When I went to the place, the first design operation we did was expand the existing streets, creating 12 similar blocks that are similar and features that are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some points for the idea of <unk> doors with straight lines, and this altered the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the small cell in the project, like <unk> as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in climate <unk>
And it is <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore natural <unk>
So <unk> a scheme that claims that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the low plant we have all the connections to the pedestrians.
And it also responds to the local norms that are set up a higher density at higher levels and a lower density in the plant down.
And it also reinforces this idea of doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space space of the project is almost like giving the community into the space and occupied space.
It's where all the neighbors are able to climb up and <unk> and make these activities like running a <unk> race in the morning, or jump into a building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach to design process.
And in addition, they're in the emerging countries, where cities can literally grow.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the lives of people changing communities and local economies at the same rate growing buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture by looking for simple solutions, but we need to improve the relationship between the community and the environment and that they have as objective to connect nature to people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl entered our class. It was as <unk> as you see all the new girls.
I had huge amounts of hair very bright and a little <unk> of <unk> <unk> was super strong for the capitals of states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy until I had my sinister <unk>
One day I stayed after the back of the school, I was a little afternoon and I hid in the <unk>
When the coast was <unk> salt salt, I walked into the classroom, I took off the <unk> table, I took on the table of my master's book <unk>
And then I did.
I took <unk> ratings just a little bit, just a few times.
All the <unk>  And I signed up the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other partners had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all rows from <unk> and myself just like a row of a row there, because I <unk>
I'm still surprising to what I did.
I don't understand how the idea worked.
I don't understand why I felt so good at me.
I felt very important.
I don't understand why I would never <unk>
It's that it was all <unk>
I will never <unk>
But most of all, I <unk> the reason why I was bothered by doing this little girl, it was so good for you."
I hate jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
And also the <unk> the <unk> are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause in the U.S.
And yet, I have never seen a study that would use loneliness, or long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the laboratory where we study them in all their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it was an exaggeration to say that if there was no no literature. I would have no literature.
Well, there would be no <unk> I wouldn't have <unk>
There was no <unk> King <unk> or a <unk>
I wouldn't have Shakespeare.
<unk> the <unk> lists of high school, because we'd be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would not have <unk> or <unk> we would have <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
No jealousy no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the pain, almost like all of them.
This year is spent 100 years of his work saying, "In <unk> <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and as well as the <unk> -- my God, everything we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details of it, right?
We think of a kid trying to reconcile the dream.
We think of a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard it is that image.
We forgot how it is.
I mean, it's about books that West <unk> said they were so <unk> like <unk> <unk>
I don't know what the cat <unk> but we suppose it's <unk>
Let's see why they are so well together, the novel and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
It will be very obvious as the pain, which reduced to the person, your desire to <unk> are a good narrative <unk>
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel <unk> we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel wrong.
Being <unk> and audience, we know exactly what details do you mean to <unk> the tree, right?
<unk> do us all <unk> <unk> and that's something that <unk> understood.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could you treat others, maybe right now."
And it starts to say to himself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every cool genuine <unk> <unk> in his lover, he adds it to his collection of instruments to torture in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> <unk> would have to abandon the country, if they wanted to break it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an <unk> emotion.
And how are the <unk>
<unk> are <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
The <unk> like the great amounts of bright hair, and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> came out of the photos.
That's why <unk> is so successful --  <unk> links well <unk> with jealousy.
When <unk> is in his agony of <unk> suddenly listening to the doors and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then defending those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an ancient text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's a scientific research with real value value.
<unk> is trying to demonstrate that the <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they are search for knowledge, search for reality, a really painful truth of the truth, of course, to <unk> <unk> the more agonizing the truth better.
<unk> <unk> <unk> These were the <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need -- that makes us suffer, causes us to cause us a whole range of feelings much more profound and vital than a wise man who can <unk> us.
It's telling us that we're going to look for <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that the <unk> reveal ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> this particular way.
There's some other emotion <unk> our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a young young man who was consumed with the idea that his wife would <unk>
And Freud said that there was something weird in that man who was not <unk> in what his wife did.
Because she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that his wife, without realizing <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> with a man?
Freud said that the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
So novels are very good at this.
So novels described really well how they <unk> they make us look at intensity but <unk>
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, more we become aware of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, the <unk> take us to do violent and illegal acts.
<unk> are pushing us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about myself for eight years, I think, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman from Michigan in 52 years old, was captured by having created a false account on Facebook since they were sending horrible messages to itself, for one year.
Over a year, a whole year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend from her former <unk> I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
How massive, even though it comes creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a novel <unk> <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very weird and brilliant character in American literature.
This is the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> who are trying to how the customer, take our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of jealousy, the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Let's take <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want what you have to take for your own and <unk> whatever you ever <unk> and it's under the floor -- he <unk> your name, it takes your rings, empty your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the <unk> <unk>
I can't tell you all the world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live at times of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social networks, where the currency is the <unk> right?
The novels, show us the <unk> I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters are always doing when they're not sure, when they're at a mystery.
Let's go to Baker Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think of the <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I always have <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius -- but he bothers him.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs your help, but they <unk> it, and it <unk> with <unk> in each of those puzzles.
But how do you work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the <unk> <unk> once <unk> <unk> <unk> all of his solution, <unk> <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells you that there is no person in <unk> <unk> who didn't want to raise your hand.
It's one of the times that we see <unk> <unk> in history. I think this is very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a problem of geometry, no excitement.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute you're on the same side.
All of a sudden, <unk> was allowed to admire that idea of being <unk>
It could still be so simple?
What if <unk> are really a question of geometry, just a question where we allow ourselves to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to <unk> the greatness of the other.
We can do it with it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we hope that happens, we remember we have the fiction for <unk>
Only fiction is <unk> jealousy.
The fiction used to invite them to the table.
And look at what <unk> the sweet <unk> the <unk> Tom <unk> the lunatic <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On the 21st of July in 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> belt of Apollo 11 and he landed on the <unk> Sea.
Armstrong and <unk> were alone, but their presence on the gray surface is the culmination of a collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest <unk> in American history.
To reach the moon, NASA took about 180 billion dollars from today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave about 400,000 people to about 400,000 people and asked 20,000 companies, universities and U.S. agencies.
They died people, including the Apollo crew <unk>
But before the Apollo program took 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> walked on top of his surface, which was <unk> after death death, last year, is now the most <unk>
So why did we care?
They didn't take a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old old and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why do you say? The cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy in Rice University in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some people ask, why <unk>
Why turn it into our goal?
And you could also ask, why scale the mountain <unk>
Thirty-five years ago, why <unk>
Why plays Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo was not just a victory of the West on the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was the <unk> of the powers of technology.
They were because it was great power to do that.
The landing on the moon occurred in a context of a long list of technological <unk>
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, they were <unk> the <unk> and eliminated the smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a boat with a candle, but in 1969, the <unk> of the Apollo <unk> flew 20 miles away from an hour.
Since 1970s, no human being has gone to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the <unk> of the Apollo 10, and the <unk> <unk> about the power of the technology has been <unk> to see that the problem we imagine that technology would solve as to go to Mars, create clean energy, curing cancer, or to feed the world population appears to be <unk>
I remember <unk> <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't get to the tube of escape <unk> from the long Saturn Saturn <unk>
I knew this would be the last mission, but I was completely confident that I would have to see the colonies on Mars.
So that surely occurred to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It seems like the technologists had <unk> and they had enriched us with trivial toys, things like <unk> applications and social media, or algorithms that speed <unk>
There's nothing wrong in most of these things.
They've extended and enriched our lives.
But we don't <unk> the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, that <unk> who have created less ambitious companies than <unk> from the years that you <unk> <unk> Microsoft, or Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are <unk> in particular, incentives that venture capitalists are offering entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused you to <unk> the creation of <unk> ideas for funding or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It <unk> mostly what's wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when venture capitalists were on their peak high point without worrying about risk, they preferred little investments that could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always been problems in order to invest with benefit in technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and social capital -- has no invested in developing technologies that are dedicated to solving big problems because they don't have commercial value immediately.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we chose not to fix the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going on Mars would require a political decision that is popular, and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't fix the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the global energy consumption comes from renewable energy sources like solar and wind percent, less than two percent, and the reason it's completely critical.
coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want sources of alternative energy that can compete at the price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree about what policies and international treaties develop the development of <unk> energy, <unk> a significant increase in research and development development and some kind of control of the <unk>
But there is no hope in the current political climate that we're going to see is a U.S. energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that looked like technological, they're not going to be.
We know from time that famines are a result of failure in the food <unk>
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are policies that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like the harvest or systems for the storage and <unk> but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't really understand the problem.
President <unk> declared cancer to cancer in 1971, but soon we found out that there are many types of cancer, some <unk> of the treatment, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve the problems with technology.
We can and we need, but these four elements have been <unk> and the political leaders and the population should want to solve the problem, the institutions must support the <unk> must really be a problem of <unk> and we need to understand it.
The mission mission that has become something like a metaphor for the capacity for the technology to solve big problems, is true with those guidelines.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no <unk> competition like the Cold War, there is no politician like John <unk> who <unk> how difficult it and dangerous, and there's no popular science of science as the solar system of exploring the solar system.
In general, to go to the moon just turned out to be simple.
I was only three days.
And really, I wasn't even getting a lot of a problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows we don't really have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Now, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with you <unk> <unk> ideas that have about trust.
They're so common that they have become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a huge decrease of trust, is a very widespread dialogue.
The second one is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should regain the trust.
I think the <unk> and the task has <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a job, which I think gives you a more clear idea about the subject.
First of all, why people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I turn it to think that there may be gone in some activities or institutions and that could have increased in others.
I don't have sure.
But I can take them to <unk> surveys and opinion surveys are supposed to be the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at surveys all over time, there's no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who <unk> 20 years ago, mainly journalists and political follow <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very trustworthy 20 years ago, they still be quite <unk> judges, nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and, by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost entirely halfway down.
But is this evidence enough?
What the opinion <unk> are, of course, opinions.
What else can you do?
What you're looking at is <unk> attitudes that people are doing when they ask certain questions.
<unk> in <unk> <unk> in <unk>
Now, if someone asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in <unk> teachers.
You probably ask for asking, "What do you do?
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you might say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust you for some, but in some other not."
It's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit trust and <unk>
We don't assume that the level of confidence we are going to feel for a particular kind of official, and the father or a person, is going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, to say I trust a certain teacher in elementary elementary school that I know to give the kind of reading, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all of that knowledge when we think of trust in a <unk> way.
I think these surveys are very bad tools to measure the real standard of real trust -- because they're trying to <unk> the moral judgment of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what happens to the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid goal.
It's not that the goal I <unk>
I tend to get more confidence in what you're happy, but not what it isn't.
Ultimately, I am <unk> not to rely on what's not reliable.
And I think those people who <unk> their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> that then disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think, well, yeah, they were too <unk>
More confidence is not an intelligent goal in this life.
<unk> <unk> or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right goal.
Once you say, yes, OK, yeah, that's what it means that what matters is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What is about doing a judgment of how trustworthy people are in certain ways.
And I think that to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that one person is <unk> in raw subjects and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, on the contrary, they're not <unk> we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest -- but not to <unk> them to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure they can make certain things, but I see that you can take your own <unk>
And I'm happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends who are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If this is like that, I still have no <unk>
But that's what we're looking at, to hear before confidence.
<unk> is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to be <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we've tried to build systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions, professional officials and others, that made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember one time I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you see the problem is that it takes more time to make the <unk> that I want to attend to <unk>
And we found the same problem in all our public and <unk> that the accountability system that is meant to ensure the <unk> and the evidence of <unk> actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is <unk> the work of people who have to do hard tasks like <unk> <unk> that we <unk> as we say.
I'm sure you all know similar examples.
We put it all together for the target.
I think that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if you want to be trusting it from trust, and it <unk> the people that we are trusted and whether to determine whether other people people, government are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, simple, simple action, which doesn't do properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> the task to rebuild trust, puts things upside down.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit about trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people together, trying to improve confidence.
But trust, ultimately is <unk> because they give them other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the <unk> so you can trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, it's because you can't <unk> all the people all the time.
But you also have to contribute <unk> evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That makes daily, everywhere, makes the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple <unk> example.
The store where I buy my socks on -- says I can <unk> without giving any techniques.
I take them and get the money, or I change the color of the color I want.
That's great. I rely on them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you get vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good test that you're worthy of trust and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So in the end, I think what we're pointing is not very hard to <unk>
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
Since the beginning of computers we have been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen that the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone <unk> more and more and more and more than one millimeter, the thickness of a <unk> screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I wonder, and if I didn't have <unk>
I started imagining how to <unk>
So first he created this tool that goes out in the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen transfers your physical body to pixels.
Designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool break the barriers.
But the two hands stay still on the screen.
How can you get inside and interact with digital information using the whole dexterity of your hands?
In the Science of Science <unk> at Microsoft, with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a small space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
<unk> a see-through bombsight with chambers of depth to detect the fingers and the face, then you can now lift the hands of the keyboard, get inside of space space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like the windows and archives have a location in the actual space, <unk> it is as easy as a <unk>
You can look through the book and <unk> line or words with the virtual touch sensor, that are down below every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with your hands.
In these examples, we <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and make digital information to us to us?
<unk> a lot of us would have bought and ordered things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a <unk> <unk> or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought, instead of just looking at pixels in space, how we can make them be physical so that we can make them <unk> and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the Media Lab at MIT with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> <unk> we created this only physical egg.
This <unk> imam behaves like a pixel in 3D space, which means that the computer as users can move the object anywhere within this tiny, three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of levitation and <unk> mechanical and <unk>
And by leveraging the object, the object release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach you physically physically and distance, and the famous shot of Michael Jordan, you can reproduce as a physical reality, the times we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and unlike <unk> or textbooks or textbooks -- this is a real experience and palpable that you can play and feel.
But what's more fascinating than changing the physics of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, the digital information is not just showing us something but that will begin to act directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without us have to <unk> ourselves from our world.
We start today talking about a barrier, but if you put that barrier, the only limit that is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was thrilled to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1960s.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to interview a school for athletes with all the overhead strategy.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution, they believed that there was only a top-down path towards <unk> a safe and good job.
No matter if I work I'd like it or not.
But my dream was to be an African American historian.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
One of the opera singer must start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to school school.
Until I wrote to the director of the school and when I read a radio show.
But no adult would tell you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends loved me, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at age 15, I knew it was too much too much to train.
My dream never <unk>
<unk> that during the rest of my life a second <unk> happiness was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one in me wanted to <unk>
Tell the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- I arrived in 1995, in 1995, and what were the first books I read here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about the Chinese <unk> life.
And it's not a forged <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment of me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
<unk> I said, "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this path of guilt <unk> and to <unk> the relationship to my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also gave me a place to my <unk>
<unk> a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning this map seemed to me out of place because this is what students in China learn.
I had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves people's perspective.
<unk> <unk> is not new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are all the way up to form of research as a traditional <unk> and literature <unk>
<unk> and <unk> offers to the academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And so I thought if I set the comparative reading work for research, why not do it as well as <unk>
So I started reading books from two.
They may be <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For <unk> <unk> are economic and <unk>
For Buddha, they are all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> Interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Instead of losing in translation, I found that you can get a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> Chinese is literally <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk>
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and present.
I know I'm not going to go to feeling or powerless never.
Having a broken dream <unk> is really nothing compared to what a lot of others have ever met.
I've come to believe that I'm not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect to the place that the dreams, of where the passion, of where the passion comes from.
Until a broken dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, I'm here happy -- happy to live again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology, at Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
Alex came into the first session using jeans and a <unk> I threw on the couch and threw my shoes off my <unk> and told me that I wanted to talk about their problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> like <unk>
And I had a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could manage it.
But I didn't.
With the stories of <unk> that Alex brought back to the <unk> it made me really easy to move my head while I would raise the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> said Alex, and what I saw, she was right.
You start to work afterwards, you get home, she has kids later, until death goes on.
In order to <unk> like Alex and I had plenty of time.
But shortly afterwards, my <unk> <unk> me to press Alex who would talk about his life <unk>
I <unk>
I said, "Yes, it's coming out with guys under their category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like it to marry him."
And then my developer said, "No, no, but maybe it <unk> with the next.
In addition, the best time to work in the marriage of Alex is before they were <unk>
This is what psychologists call <unk>
It was when I realized that the <unk> aren't the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what was <unk> but it didn't make the <unk> of Alex being a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect time and we were <unk>
And so I realized that this kind of <unk> <unk> was a real problem and I had real consequences, not just to Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, families and future <unk> everywhere.
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think that nobody gets to adulthood without going to go before by the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yeah. They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take a piece of dream, you take a <unk> I want to see -- it's OK -- <unk> the <unk> matter.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will go to 35 years.
This means eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments that give her life to their life will have happened to be 30 and <unk>
<unk> more than 40, they don't <unk>
This audience will be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race have an exponential impact on how much money they <unk>
We know that more than half of Americans are married, they live or come out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and final stage of growth in its <unk> and <unk> for <unk> which means that if there is something you want to change yourself -- now it's time to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than any other time of life and we know that the female fertility comes to their top and the things become complicated at <unk>
<unk> are the time for <unk> on their body and their choices.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which its everyday life and common life has an <unk> impact on the person who <unk>
But what we don't hear often is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the timeline of <unk>
The researchers call the <unk> a <unk>
The journalists called <unk> names to the <unk> like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we have considered a <unk> which is actually the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to make big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
That's not it?
What do you think about when you get your <unk> on your head and say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole it to that person the urgency of urgency and her ambition and doesn't happen absolutely anything.
And then every day, as interesting as you or your kids and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know that my boyfriend is not good for me, but this <unk> ratio, I'm just killing me time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I start a career before the 30, everything will be right."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better listen to the day that I graduated.
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game of chairs.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some point around the 30, he crashed the music and everybody started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only thing to be standing, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the closest chair when I had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit of end, but not the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of stuff for <unk> there's a huge pressure to the <unk> and so many of them will start a career, pick a partner, and to have two or three children in a very short period of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there are research that you start to show, which is much harder and stressful <unk> to do everything from once to <unk>
The average marriage crisis is not about buying red <unk>
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
Realizing you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves and me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story of how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
By 25, Emma came to my office because he was, in his own words, having a crisis of identity.
He said he would like to work in art or in entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as <unk>
As it was cheaper, she lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And in spite of living very hard, very difficult life had been even more difficult.
They were often often in our <unk> but then she was going to wake up, "You don't choose his family, but he can choose his friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and he cried for almost the entire hour.
He had just bought a new book for <unk> and I had spent the whole morning working with her many relationships, but then he was looking at the empty space that followed after the words <unk> for <unk> Please call me <unk>
She was about the <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of me if I <unk>
At that time, I had a lot of work to resist and I don't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> which was actually <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as I used to sit while the previous decade of Emma went ahead.
So, for the next weeks and months, I said to Emma three things that every <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma who <unk> that identity of identity and <unk> capital of identity.
capital capital capital capital -- I mean doing something that adds up value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what you want to be after.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and no one knows the future of work, but I know this: <unk> capital generates capital of identity.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that you want to try it.
I'm not <unk> exploration, I am <unk> the exploration that I should not count, that by the way, is not the <unk>
It's <unk>
I said to Emma who would explore jobs and I did it.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you at the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with similar minds to whom you know what you know how to think about, how they talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who will come out almost always comes from its closest stop.
The new things come from what you call the weak links friends of their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have jobs.
But the other half won't, and the weak bonds are the way of <unk> to this group.
Half of the everyday jobs that are created is never <unk> then, knowing the chief of your neighbor is how to get a <unk> work.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is happening.
Last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose his family, but I know her friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as <unk> Emma would soon raise her family, when she has a partner and there is a form of his own family.
I told him that the time to choose his family had come.
You may think that 30 is better enough to sit down, which 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live now or <unk> now when everyone in Facebook are starting to walk into the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you do it, and that means to be as <unk> in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family needs to be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just to work or kill time with anyone who will be <unk> to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the <unk> of a cousin who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak bond helped him get a job there.
That offer of labor gave her a reason to leave the boyfriend, so he alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This married a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, she loves her new family, and I send myself a letter that said, "Now the spaces of emergency peace are not enough.
The history of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
The <unk> are as planes coming out of Los Angeles, and they come to some place in the West.
Just before the <unk> a light fits in its trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or in <unk>
Likewise, at 21 or 25 or 25 and even the <unk> a good conversation, a good TED Talk -- a good TED Talk can have enormous effects in the next few years or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea worthy of spreading all the <unk>
It's as simple as I learned to say to <unk>
This is what I have the privilege of saying to the <unk> like Emma all day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get in identity, use their weak <unk> choose your family.
Don't you stop who they didn't know or not.
They're deciding their lives today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very tough job in management <unk> for a job that was even more <unk> <unk>
I went to teach you mathematics in the middle schools in New York schools.
And like any professor, I applied tests and tests.
So let me assignments.
When I was doing it, you will <unk> grades.
What I called my attention was that <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the people who had a better performance had predicted <unk> <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not doing so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in the seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was so convinced that every single one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and over time.
After many years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure better ways.
It's the <unk> but what happens if you succeed at school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn it fast and <unk>
So I left the classroom and I went to college to become <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all sorts of <unk> <unk> and in every study my question was, who has a success here and why?
My research team and I went to <unk> West <unk>
And we're trying to predict what they <unk> <unk> on military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> National <unk> and tried to predict what kids would do the best possible in the competition.
We studied <unk> professors working in the very difficult neighborhoods, what teachers are still teaching for at the end of the school year and from <unk> who will be the most effective to improve the outcomes of their <unk>
We partnered with private enterprises, wondering what of these marketers are going to keep their <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all these very different contexts, it emerged a feature as an important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health and was not <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to achieve long-term goals.
<unk> is to have a <unk>
<unk> is clinging to your future day after day, not just for the month, but for years, and working hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not <unk>
A few years ago, I started studying determination in the English schools of Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to do my questionnaires of determination and then waited for over a year to see those who were <unk>
It turns out that children with the most determination they had significantly greater likely to <unk> even though the <unk> in every single quality that I could measure, things like family income, the results of <unk> <unk> even safety that they felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point, or in the <unk> National <unk> in which it matters <unk> it's also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
To me, the most powerful thing about determination is how little we know, how little the science knows about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do the determination for children?
What should I do to teach kids a solid ethic of work?
How do I keep it motivated for the long <unk>
The more honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give you purpose.
Our data shows very clearly that there are a lot of talented individuals who are simply trying to just stay ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, which is commonly related to whether it's related to the talent measures.
So far, the best idea I've ever heard about developing the determination of children is something called <unk>
This is an idea that we developed at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not <unk> that it can change with effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows on response to the challenge, they're much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have on the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure whether they've been successful, and we need to be willing to fail, to <unk> to start with all new lessons with the lessons themselves.
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> <unk> is my mother, the beauty, the shape and the Chinese characters.
So since that moment, I was going to go through this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that whatever you want to understand and appreciating the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method to learn Chinese might be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20 thousand characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic design.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature enough to read from <unk> menus from <unk> to understand the basic idea of web pages.
Today I will start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as much as it is possible until it's <unk>
You get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to give a ride.
<unk>
If the shape of the fire is a person with her arms in both sides, as if I was shouting at <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> -- this is actually <unk> the way it's called, but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The next door on the door looks like a couple doors of a <unk> in the old West.
I call <unk> these eight characters.
These are building blocks so they think many more characters.
One person.
If you walk back, that's <unk>
As the old man, two is company, three are <unk>
If a person comes through your arms, this person is saying <unk> this big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> <unk> in the whale.
A tree is a two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the foundations of the <unk>
Put a mouth on the tree, which is a <unk>  <unk> -- because a single tree is pretty idiot.
Remember the <unk>
Two <unk> they do so hot.
Three <unk> that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
You put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
You see, you put a board inside the gate, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
Do you have someone at home?
This person is coming out of a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, are <unk>
Three women together, have care <unk>
So we've spent for almost 30 characters.
By using this method -- the first eight <unk> will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other <unk>
So with every little effort, you will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same as you learn a Chinese for eight years.
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the Earth of the sun.
This is a sun that was put in the beginning, because Japan is to China.
So a sun next to the beginning, we created Japan.
A person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two stacked mountains one of the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, I've become a <unk>
A mouth that tells you where we come out is an exit.
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and go down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be dad is the movies that I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician magician together.
The film took his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a bright dress and take a magic wand
But when you look at that movie as many times, you get to understand it's extraordinary.
We now live and raising our children into a kind of industrial complex show of <unk> <unk>
However, the magician magician was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took 40 years later to date, interestingly, another movie whose <unk> a metal boy and a young boy named a girl with a girl with her <unk>
You know what I'm talking about?
There is a big difference between these two films, there's a couple of big differences between the magician magician and all the films that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the Oz was doing today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the <unk>
<unk> magical shoes to defeat the stockpiles of the evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another single thing about the <unk> magician is that the most <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I started noticing this when I did see "Star <unk> to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, he also had a son.
Within three years.
It wasn't invited to <unk> because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second child, and the level of supervision had <unk>  So he was on the room and he was struck as a mom with his <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was going on, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be value issues, <unk> and <unk>
I should have a sense that Luke got a military to <unk> the government?
This is the <unk>
How do you win <unk> your movie?
They do good <unk> with everybody and being a <unk>
It is the kind of world that I want my children to grow up with <unk> and not a world of men that <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much <unk> capital capital in the movies for our children, as little on the path of flying <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of men's violence in girls, and they should be <unk> It's really good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know by the experience that Princess <unk> doesn't provide the proper framework that had served me to navigate the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the time of the first <unk> he was hoping that the credits were actually expected to appear because it's the end of the film, right?
My quest is finished, I have <unk>
Why keep there?
I don't know what I should do.
The films are focused on defeat the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a <unk> animal, and if you're a girl, you have to wear a <unk> suit.
There's a lot of exceptions, and I stand for the <unk> of Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to the children, even though they are not really their target public.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to defend themselves against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend from <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, as real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful subject of all of the time is still going to come up with each of the times after classic each of them about a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and the child, or two men who are <unk> a child.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Do you remember what the critic said when it came out.
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, almost none of these movies passes the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not <unk> and <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a book <unk> and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation I'd had a friend of the <unk> of movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that you have to look at, in the film, there are more than a female character who has <unk>
So, you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something else from the kid that you both like it?  Okay? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things with each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet I rarely see it in the cinema we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good <unk> movie.
Right? <unk> from <unk> success -- an idea of consensus about what a <unk> movie <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
And I don't think <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in a <unk> where men and women are hidden during the <unk> crisis.
We have many scenes of men who have deep conversations and painful in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the <unk> to take a look at the door and say, <unk> the bed <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's put it in the numbers.
In 2011, in the 100 more popular films how many of them think they have actors are <unk>
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women that we've chosen for Congress, is okay.
But there's a bigger number that this is going to <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said.
One in the United States, one in five women say it's been sexually assaulted once in his life.
I don't think it's the <unk> of the mass entertainment.
I don't think movies for children have something to do with that.
I also don't believe that music music or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that <unk> one of the things that I think is there is a lot of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are they <unk>
What don't they do <unk>
They're <unk> the story that the role of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very alarming statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our <unk> like <unk> <unk> and we hope that <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> will <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their own power.
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean primarily by parents.
I think we need to show our children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of masculinity is changing radically.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role of the <unk> and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite favorite character, Do you know what he did?
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do you have in common?
Maybe it's not just a brilliant gown,
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them achieve their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories in which I tell my <unk> Go and fight only and more stories where his job looked like their work is to join a team -- maybe a team that was led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I was living in Maine, and one of the things I thought about was looking for <unk> of the <unk> on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that that would be lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand, and it's hard to see.
However, over time, I was <unk> to <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and archeology.
And I finally started studying <unk> I realized that I saw my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, anyway, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine, I had grown up to one of almost 1.3 miles of length along the <unk>
And my sea cookies grew to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite imagery.
To try and make a map of the past, I knew I had to see it differently.
So I want to show you an example of how different we see the <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern <unk> of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, it seems to be <unk> but when we use infrared and we process it using pure color, suddenly the place looks like <unk>
What you're looking at is the actual chemical changes of the landscape of construction and the <unk> activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we used the satellite data to find a single city, old city, called <unk> losing for thousands of years.
<unk> was the old capital of the former Egypt for over 400 years in a time period called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place in the European <unk> and it's really important because in the Middle Ages, there was this great renaissance of ancient <unk> <unk> architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> them inside the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is massive, it's about <unk> miles away.
Before, <unk> <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved to this one and covered all the city.
So how do you find a city that's a <unk> <unk>
And I'll try to find that one guy at random would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with your eyes, and using baseball.
So we used NASA data from NASA to make a map of place, very subtle changes.
So we were able to see where they <unk> the <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly high area that looks inside the circle here, that we thought it might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with Egyptians doing <unk> jobs -- you can see here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots show in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human <unk>
Five feet down, below a thick thick layer of <unk> we found a dense layer of <unk>
This means that in this possible location of <unk> about five feet down, we have a <unk> of <unk> from several hundred years ago, from the Middle Empire exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> which proves that there was a shop of <unk>
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the <unk> of the Middle Empire these are the stones that are <unk>
So, we have a dense layer of <unk> that comes back from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence from a elite jewelry shop showing that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find any <unk> here, but we <unk> to the place in a near future for <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also perform great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Atlantic <unk> which was probably written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
To share knowledge is the highest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on land.
So you know, TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do the ideas happen really started in 1984 B.C. <unk> in a missing city not for a long time and found from the top.
It certainly puts the search for <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, front of the front door of <unk> house.
And I want you to pay attention to the color of the gate, the material that you're made.
Now let's look at a group of <unk> obese group.
They are competing in a <unk> race and they're in the direction of their <unk>
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> they're <unk> they're <unk> they're <unk>
And they collide in front of their doorstep.
There are <unk> flying everywhere, wheels that pass on the side, the <unk> of the wheels that end up in <unk> <unk> <unk> the threshold line.
At the lobby, or what there's on the other side of the door, and watch the quality of the light, the light's shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with the hand.
From his chair on a brown horse on a brown horse.
It's a horse that talks about.
They can feel your blue <unk> making your nose.
You can smell the cookie cookie and you roll that it's about getting into the mouth.
I would go around and enter your living room.
Already in the room, and making the peak of his imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
He's with little clothes, dancing over his middle downtown singing <unk>
Now let's go back to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a <unk> road and from the <unk> you come to you <unk> <unk> Man <unk> and the <unk> of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping around.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular competition that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, <unk> I suppose, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few ladies and different habits and hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- look at them just once.
<unk> the names of dozens and dozens of strangers.
We had whole of poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize the faster the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people must be nature's phenomena.
And I started talking with some of the competitors.
This is a guy named Ed Cook who had come from England to have one of the best <unk>
I asked him, "How did you realize that you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have average memory.
All those people participate in this competition say they have normal memory.
"We have trained to perform these miraculous acts of memory using some old techniques invented two year ago in Greece, the same techniques that used to <unk> to memorize their speeches -- and that the <unk> <unk> used to memorize books.
And my reaction was, "How did I have heard of this <unk>
We were standing outside of the room of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant language, although a little <unk> said to me, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? Why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how do you memorize the order on a deck of cards in live television on national television.
So that would give the world that anyone can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me myself.
I mean, you have to start something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey to me.
And I ended up going through most of the year -- not just training my memory, but also a lot of trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what is their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a guy named <unk>
He is <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that he had a problem of <unk> is awesome.
Someone is incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows us to see what point our memory makes us who we are.
At the other end of the spectrum, I met this guy.
This is Kim <unk> based on the <unk> paper <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We went one afternoon together in the public library of Salt Lake City -- <unk> <unk> <unk>
And by coming back, I read a number of treaties about the memory written about 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of interesting things.
One of the most interesting things that I learned is that there was a time when this idea of being <unk> and disciplined and <unk> was not such a weird thing as it might seem like today.
Long ago, people spend on their memory, to provide their own minds.
These techniques have actually made our modern world, but they've also changed us.
They have changed the glacier, and I would argue that they've changed our cognitive stuff.
Like we have no need to remember, sometimes we seem to have forgotten how to do it.
One of the most places on our planet where you find people are passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory is this competition as singular of memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there are <unk> <unk>
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College in London invited a collection of memory to the lab.
They wanted to know: Is it going to have brains in some ways, structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They're just more intelligent than <unk>
They gave them a battery for cognitive test, and the answer was actually not.
There was yet a really interesting difference between the brains of memory <unk> and the subjects of control and the <unk>
When they put them into a <unk> MRI MRI machine, <unk> their brains as they <unk> faces and forms of <unk> they found that in the memory of memory <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
They actually <unk> or looked at a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> <unk> is driving as a race race where each year has a new way to remember more things, more quickly, and then the rest of competitors should be <unk>
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times <unk> memory.
On his desk, in front of him, there's 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> who's about to try to memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and he was just <unk>
He used a <unk> technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
<unk> Yes.
And as there is a lot of ways to remember things in these rooms, absolutely all the techniques used by the end of a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates an paradox known as the <unk> <unk> <unk> says, "I know two people who remember the same word. I say to you, <unk> that there's a man named <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> that there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I wonder how to <unk> that word I told you a <unk>
Did you know what <unk>
The person who said that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who said that his job is <unk>
The same word, unlike <unk> that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name is <unk> it doesn't mean nothing for you. It has no relationship to you.
With all the other memories you dance on his head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use white <unk>
They have <unk> hands.
They do well when they come home to work.
Probably <unk> some <unk>
And when <unk> that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some time back.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this is about five thousand years ago in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
And the story is this: There was a poet called <unk> who went to a <unk>
And they had hired him as entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a really good party, and you didn't bring it to a <unk> he <unk>
He stood up, he <unk> her memory, and he <unk> and it was very quickly, the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> everybody.
But not only killed them all, but it shattered the headless <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where you were.
So you could not be able to <unk> the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
<unk> standing outside, only <unk> in the middle of the rubble, shut the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I have been sitting every day.
I took the <unk> family <unk> where they were their loved ones between rubble.
What you see in that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and is that no matter whether we are not good at remembering names or phone numbers or instructions -- word for the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and <unk>
If you were to tell me that I was going to tell you the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> is very likely to be very hard to do it.
But I would bet that if you were to tell you who you were sitting on the horse <unk> brown in his lobby, you'd be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of the memory is to create this building with the eyes of his mind and <unk> images with the things that you want to remember the <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> is the image, the <unk> self.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, the first <unk> memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
So let's say that you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and want to make it memory about the same way that I would have made it <unk> if you were invited to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine you're at the door of your house.
And I'll come up with some sort of crazy image and crazy and <unk> to help you remember that the first thing you want to talk about is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and see the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
And that would remind you that they want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you'll see Britney <unk> to remind you that anecdote that you want to count.
And then they fly in the kitchen, and the fourth subject that they would talk about would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help you remember it.
This is how the speakers are <unk> <unk> their speeches -- not word for words, which is going to confuse them by typical <unk>
In fact, the <unk> term comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> of when people thought about the <unk> and in the rhetoric with this sort of spatial terms.
The phrase was: first <unk> would be like the first place in his <unk>
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I got stuck in full of it.
I went to some of these kinds of memory and I had the idea of writing something about the <unk> of <unk> conflict.
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is an incredibly boring event.
It seriously, is like seeing a lot of people sitting on <unk> I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone gets in front of you.
I'm a journalist and I need to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I have no access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in her place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I went to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old <unk> school stopped a market market.
And I discovered that this was <unk>
I would have never been waiting for you."
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What is actually trying to do is enhance more and more the ability to create and imagine these images that are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of mind.
And I was pretty touched with this.
This is me, using my training team for the memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and some safety glasses covered with tape leaving only two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory <unk>
I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year earlier before, and I had the idea that it could be done in a sort of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could serve for good <unk> for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something I had to happen.
Of course, it's nice to <unk> <unk> and phone numbers, but actually this is not the point.
These are just <unk> <unk> that work.
Because they're based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to put them to build <unk> from memory or memorize <unk> <unk> to profit with a little bit of <unk> about how your mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was trying to <unk> but it's not the case.
Big memories <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus on deeply.
The palace of the <unk> These music techniques, are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us.
<unk> a deep processing kind of processing -- sort of a complete interest that most of them is not moving around there.
But the reality is that there is no shortcuts.
This is how things do <unk>
And if there is something I want to leave you with today is what I <unk> the <unk> I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem left to me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose anything that is our short existence of <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks into our side, we're going to be so <unk> that we don't even be interested in process in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory skills in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you have to be the kind of person you remember remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, and so we <unk> just a <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> I was <unk> I had six years old, and I lived there in my parents' home in a town called <unk> and this was my bedroom <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom to share with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that was going to be.
And there you all spent the time watching the <unk> So every time I went from my room to the bathroom, everyone looked at me and every time I was going on, and I would walk down on a towel -- all I saw me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> and I hated it.
It hated that tour, I hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
All right.
Those emotions that I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, or division of areas, but of those connections, emotional <unk> that we feel in the places that are <unk>
And it's no wonder that we feel like that, because according to the <unk> Protection Agency --  Americans spend 90 percent of their time under your roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines us in ways that we don't even realize it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you <unk> you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know what you think about based on a building that was constructed a half thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that uses architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an <unk> emotional connection, we've used this trick for a very, very long time.
We use it 200 years to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build science museums.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build homes.
Look, these <unk> <unk> <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very helpful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a lot of time and it's very complicated.
People who <unk> the <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found them with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Library of <unk> that ended up in 2004, in my hometown, and you know, it has a <unk> you have this little round of columns, <unk> red -- that let me <unk> what <unk> is to communicate with this <unk> the children, the values values -- history.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, ended up another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and sharing.
So how is it possible for the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called <unk> are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works at the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects constantly drive new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for the shapes of living life.
We were going to do it and we gave them so much, that we get completely away from people.
All of the black -- this <unk> you know, you think we feel very well, but we're dead because we don't have any other option.
We need to go to the other side and go back to connect with those <unk>
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we're all happy, and so we started to experiment with <unk> we make a swing of the <unk> and over and over again. So we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course it is, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago <unk> from the 1970s.
Architects were busy experimenting with called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
That can be a guess.
<unk> small, <unk>
Really really hard.
So we approach the 1980s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
<unk> the pendulum again in the other direction.
We take those ways we know that we like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added new materials.
They love it.
We don't take <unk>
We take <unk> and we turned it into a skyscraper, that can be <unk> <unk> made of glass.
The shapes <unk> they won in audacious and <unk>
<unk> became the <unk>
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
One madness.
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spend the time in commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be the <unk> to the French or the Italian.
Maybe with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens with <unk>
This is what happens with symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we create memories from other places.
I know very well, and you all know this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
Architects are feeling frustrated and we started making <unk> the pendulum again in the other direction.
In the 1980s and in the early '90s, we started experimenting with called <unk>
<unk> the symbols of <unk> we now have new design techniques by the computer, and we found with new <unk> a few ways that are attached to other forms.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You are totally <unk>
Normally the <unk> <unk> in the opposite direction.
But then, something happened.
In 1997, it opened this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critical academics, and public in general, they agreed completely according to a building.
The New York Times <unk> <unk> this construction of <unk>
The tourism in Bilbao went up in a 2,500 percent when they finished the building.
So all the world wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody else wanted one, and it was all around the world.
He was our first architect star.
But how is it possible that these shapes wild and <unk> how is it possible that they become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media got <unk> around them, and we quickly learned that those forms meant culture and <unk>
We've created an emotional reaction with these shapes.
Same thing did the main mayors in the world.
So they all believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and <unk>
This phenomenon in the beginning of the new USA ran with other architects star.
I spent <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects, in the threshold of new millennium, actually started to move through all the architecture, the digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
You think, for example, how do we consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, you'd have to have walked up to the next village to see a building.
The transportation is <unk> you can take a boat, an aircraft can be <unk>
<unk> technology -- you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we're all <unk> of architecture, and the building is carried beyond its physical location.
Architecture is everywhere right now, that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast.
It's not quite accurate for a lot of time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings, before knowing whether he designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we met buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> <unk> but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to go back to happen. Because we're at the most <unk> threshold revolution in architecture from the invention of <unk> of steel or the <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to the <unk> media starts to move faster and faster, until it will be in both extreme extremes in <unk> and it <unk> effectively the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, architects and you, the audience.
Now we can make <unk> symbols with emotional <unk> of something completely new.
I'm going to show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, the building, it was part of the community, and as the drawings were looked at exactly the stuff over, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community, that first summer, when people started getting and shared it in social media, the building left to be just a way of communication, because these are not just images of a building, these are the images that one made of the building.
And as you use them to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with the collective memory -- and by carrying these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think of architecture.
We can tell each other, what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but they've changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building is built today, first <unk> the Internet in search of <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of games, of innovation, what can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can take the mayor of <unk> to people from <unk> and tell them that there is no only one to what a library is today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experiment.
It's all different now.
Architects are no longer that mysterious creatures that use words <unk> and graphic drawings -- and one is no longer a <unk> audience, which doesn't have seen before.
Architects can listen, and you don't leave it by the architecture of architecture.
That means that <unk> <unk> of one style to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find <unk> solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from buildings today.
This means that a public space in the old city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a Brooklyn <unk> can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad feature of a red solid brick based on ideas of what it should be a <unk>
This means that some robots can build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for ways that will produce.
That means that the buildings are <unk> to the <unk> of nature and not the reverse.
This means a parking garage, in Miami Beach, Florida, it can also serve for sport or for <unk> or even you can marry there at night.
This means that three architects can dream in swimming on the East Side of New York, and raise half a million dollars of the community together around that cause, it's no longer a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this tiny, little pavilion of <unk> and <unk> as the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what matters is what we build.
Architects already know how to make more intelligent, smarter and more kind.
We've been waiting for everybody to like.
Finally, we are no longer in place.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot in play.
Buildings not only reflect our society, but they give it way to the <unk> spaces, the local libraries of homes where we enter our children, and the <unk> to the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and she started walking.
And it does that really cool way, typical of the kids in a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for his legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do for the moment is to look in the mirror.
She really loves her reflection.
They laughed and <unk> and it gives itself these big <unk>
It's beautiful.
Apparently, all of his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it. And he made me think, when do you couple this?
How is it that we all don't love with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at <unk> "Am I <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old, and she lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be dear and fit in.
He's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It's a little bit of fear, it's a little <unk> because, despite her mom telling him all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, someone tells you that it's ugly.
Between what her mom tells me and what his friends, or the fellow of the school they say, doesn't know who you believe.
So a video of it is, it puts him on YouTube, and she asks others that please leave a <unk> "Am I beautiful or I'm <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has received over 13,000 numbers on this.
Some of these are so <unk> it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal healthy <unk> and <unk> who gets these answers in one of their most vulnerable life life, emotionally.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, in most teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it going to do this?
Well, adolescents today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, speaking <unk> giving me <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this never ends.
Never before we've been so connected in a continuous way, so so young so young.
As a mother said to me, "It's like there's a party in his bedroom all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that are coming with that are <unk>
This environment, of being always connected to our kids to <unk> based on the number of love that they have and the kinds of comments that they get.
There's no division between a life online and real life.
It's really difficult to know the differences between what real or what it is.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what is authentic and what is <unk>
What is the most important thing in the life of somebody in front of you in a matter every day?
And where are they looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> of the news of girls now.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk>
The <unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of the <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture of today.
It's not hard to see what young people compared to.
But kids are not immune to this.
And the <unk> of sports stars, and folk singers.
But what's the problem with all of this?
Well, we certainly want our children to grow healthy and be generic individuals.
But in a culture I'm obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and work to their appearance, at the price of all the other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and other aspects are starting to suffer.
Six of every 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they're not nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They're very fundamental activities for their growth as human beings and as <unk> for society and the field of the labor development.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in arguments in the classroom.
One in five are not attending at all the days when you don't feel comfortable with it.
And in the rainy season, if you don't think you look at good enough, specifically if you don't think you're sufficiently <unk> <unk> a lower note to the average of your peers who don't care about it as appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, the United States and China.
And it turns out regardless of what these young people are.
So, to keep it right, and we're talking about how you are really wrong.
The low self-esteem on its body is tracking the academic performance of it.
And it's also <unk> health.
The teenagers with little <unk> are less physical activity, they eat less fruit and vegetables, they are involved in higher diet than they can take them to a food mess.
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily <unk> by the people around them and they're at higher risk of depression.
And we think that's because of all this because of what they make more choices like alcohol consumption and drugs, diet -- surgery, aesthetic sexual relationships, no protection and <unk> damage.
The perfect search for the perfect body is pushing the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who think they're overweight again, regardless of whether or they don't have higher rates of <unk>
17 percent of women don't show up to a job interview on a day where they don't feel safe with how they can see.
Think about a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that happen be?
<unk> this potential for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking for itself, it doesn't take you far away.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key shapes, the first one is that we have to nurture trust in your own body.
We need to help our adolescents develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do so.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was really surprised when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing that.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children follow our children will not only have a positive, but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas, and the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six things are dedicated points for anyone who would be willing to provide a sense of body force that it works.
A education is a fundamental <unk> but we will deal with this problem requires each one of us to take the reigns in the issue, and let's be a better model to follow for women and girls in our own lives.
It defy the current status of how women are viewed and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell you with the contribution of our <unk> <unk> or the size of their <unk> or <unk> that the determination or the success of an <unk> athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start to judge the people by what they are, not because they can see.
We can all start by giving the responsibility for the kind of images and the comments we published in our social networks.
We can <unk> people based on their effort, and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, when was the last time you <unk> a <unk>
In summary, we have to work together as communities, as governments and as businesses, to really change our culture, so that our children grow up to value their whole person, valuing <unk> diversity, <unk>
We need to put people who are actually making the difference in a <unk>
They're going to make a difference in the real world, let's make them be those who come out on the big screen, because only we create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think they see that they will never be seen by being who they are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think of what this can mean for someone in your lives.
Who do you have in mind?
<unk>
<unk>
<unk>
<unk> A <unk>
It could be simply the woman who is two seats out of a distance. What would it mean for her if he was released from that <unk> voice in her interior, that he <unk> it for not having a long <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
What would it mean for her if we put it out, and we would take his potential for that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images are moving us together.
But let's give our kids the truth.
<unk> that the way you look at is just one part of your identity, and that truth is that we love them for those who are and for what they do, and as we feel.
<unk> to self-esteem in our schools.
So let's change each of us, the way we talk about and compared to other people.
And we went together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year age of today, they turn themselves into safe change agents of themselves tomorrow.
So let's do it.
On the five of November 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> went to a hotel in Manhattan and he killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
<unk> initially was innocent -- but being killed by other minor charges in a company of others, started planning attacks to about 12 icons of New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Luckily, those plans were <unk> by an FBI <unk>
Sadly, the bomb bomb in the World Trade Center, he couldn't escape it.
Later on, she would be convicted of his participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, as he was a <unk> engineer with a <unk> American <unk> School of elementary school between the two made all possible for me to give me a happy childhoods.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, which very few, even most Muslims -- come to meet.
By the experience I saw that when people take time to interact, they don't need much to get the same things in life.
But in all religion, in all human group, there is always a small fraction of people who are <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that we think we need to use every possible media for everybody to live like them.
A few months before her arrest and sat with me and explained to me that in the last weekend, he and some friends had been going online training in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, I was <unk> by the FBI.
When I <unk> my father helped me hold her <unk> on the shoulder, and explained how to point for about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet that shot gave him to the little orange light on the target and, for surprise you all, especially mine, the whole goal broke on fire.
My uncle was back to the other and Arabic, said <unk> <unk>
A parent, a parent, a child.
All of all, the comment had been a lot of laughter. But just a few years later I understood what they were so funny.
You saw in me, the same level of destruction, my father could <unk>
These people later quickly would be trained by putting up with 700 pounds of explosives on the underground parking parking lot on the <unk> tower in the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and <unk> other 1,000.
I admired those men.
I called it <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved through 20 times, that instability during my childhood, I couldn't do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable about someone who was time to pack and go to another city.
As I was always me to the new face of the class often was <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid the whites -- but to be the new of the silent class and <unk> it was enough <unk>
So most of the time I was going in house reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons not developed social skills to say <unk> <unk> <unk> -- not ready for the real world.
I was inspired by opera, I judge people, based on <unk> indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that I put into the test of my thinking, was during the research of 2000.
In a <unk> program that I participated in the <unk> National Convention, in Philadelphia.
My group <unk> in the subject of youth violence like I had been a victim of <unk> almost my whole life, was something I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the boys who had been done, I was Jewish age.
I took several days out of the light that I realized that there was no <unk> among the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I felt very proud of being able to beat the barrier that all of life had been made to believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment arose when I got a summer work on Bush -- a park in <unk>
And I found myself with people of all kinds of beliefs and cultures, that experience was critical in the development of my character.
All of life had taught me that the <unk> was a sin and, by extension, all of <unk> were bad <unk>
By chance, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors over there, in a show, and I could see that many of them were the most enjoyable and less critical critics that I had seen in life.
Having been a kid, I developed a sense of empathy towards the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people themselves, exactly the way I would wish to be treated.
For that feeling I could contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what that is being <unk> but I know what's going to be judged by something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart made me <unk> honest about my <unk> and helped me see the race of people, religion or sexual orientation, you have nothing to do with character.
In a lot of the ways he became my figure out in a moment where I was desperately <unk>
At occasion, the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian had had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
And one day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my thinking, and she told me something to hold in my heart forever, while he is alive.
She looked at me with my eyes tired of someone who has suffered with endless <unk> and said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that point, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all of that hatred on your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why I decided to go out and put me on a <unk>
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that someone, someday, you know, somebody is going to be trying to take the violence, I can hear my story and understand that there's a better way, that even though I was going to go to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against prejudice.
I do it by the victims of terror, and for their loved pain and the losses that terrorism has produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism to speak against those acts of <unk> as rejection to my father's actions.
With this <unk> I put up here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, which children don't have to follow the trails of their parents.
I'm not my dad.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
At this point, there is a film that projects in your minds.
It's an incredible movie film.
It's 3D <unk> and it has sound sound from what you hear and see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has <unk> taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as a time of childhood that you project in front of your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed on your flow of conscious thinking.
The <unk> heart is you who experience everything in directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of being human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have a normal internal movie you, you and you.
There is nothing to make them more directly.
At least I know I have a sense of own.
I don't have certainty you are aware of.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we were not conscious, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we need to produce results without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, no one knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate awareness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for a science of consciousness.
Now, science, by nature, is objective by nature.
The consciousness, by nature, it's <unk>
So there may never have a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, we have this vision.
Psychology was studying the pro-social behavior. The neuroscience was studying the brain -- but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, it all started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time for science <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of science work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw something about this guy in the fantastic work that I presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand a lot better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of looking at faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a <unk> science.
It's not a science science science.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of evil experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain by saying that this kind of work of neuroscience responds a few questions that we want to explain to us, the questions about what certain areas of the brain are doing and what they <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
No offense to <unk>
Actually, there is no easy problem with consciousness.
Now, not tackles the real core mystery of this <unk> Why is all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why does it exist?
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give back a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon as the <unk> as the <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emergent behaviors, how they operate the <unk> how they work -- how they work, how they work, how they are <unk> and the living organisms are questions about how the goal works.
That could apply to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we talk about, how we play <unk> all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about the behavior is between the easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question why is all of the behavior is accompanied with a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard standard of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't have much to say.
I am a <unk> scientist.
I want a scientific theory of the <unk> that works for a long time, I hit my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms of physical terms.
But at the end I got to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we would stay at this point.
We have a wonderful string of explanations -- great. We get used to this, the physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains some of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're conscious.
On the other hand, we don't know how to put that idea to our scientific worldview.
I think consciousness right now, is sort of a <unk> something that we need to integrate into our worldview, but we don't know still how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that were initially willing to be crazy before dealing with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no such difficult problem of consciousness.
The whole idea of the <unk> <unk> movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you need to do, is to explain the brain functions, the behaviors of the brain, and so is studies all that needs explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply denying that the observation of consciousness is healing.
But I'm in a different direction.
In the time we left, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
The physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as <unk> <unk> space, space and mass.
<unk> fundamental laws that <unk> like laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of anything more fundamental.
On the contrary, you think of math, and that's where the world is built.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't explain the <unk> phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space -- space, time, <unk> the basic laws of <unk> and applied to the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws would bring.
I think that's the situation we find out of consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space, time, <unk> <unk> so it mass, so that it sounds like the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> the same as a primal brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that it suddenly doesn't be the object of science.
It opens up the path for <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- space, space, time, the mass, the <unk> <unk>
The physicists sometimes say we want fundamental laws so simple that we can put them in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like that.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can put them in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for all of us, every system is <unk> not only the human, the dogs, the mice, even the microbes in Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with distress when he thinks, <unk> always traveling the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that maybe photons can have some element of feeling of feeling of feeling <unk> some primitive precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How do you think something so <unk>
In part of this comes from the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's <unk> like space and time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to be <unk> is much less for the people in different cultures, where the human mind seems more like <unk>
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful form of finding fundamental laws that <unk> thinking with the physical process, is to reconstitute consciousness with information.
And there are always information processing.
<unk> of complex <unk> like in a human being, complex awareness.
<unk> simple information, simple awareness.
Something very exciting is that in recent years a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory, and I developed <unk>
It has an mathematics measure of information, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And it's supposed to <unk> it has to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of integration of information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there's a degree of integration of information, as much significant degree of consciousness quite important.
But when you get to the material, microbes, microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller but it's not zero either.
In the <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of <unk>
In fact by providing a fundamental law of <unk> <unk> degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into the physical world.
physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality that underlies below.
As explains Stephen <unk> "Where does the fire <unk>
From <unk> the equations of physics can just leave as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists are basically described the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire in the equations.
In that view, consciousness doesn't find out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
So this vision -- I think, <unk> vision has the potential to deal with our relationship with nature, and it can be very serious and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical implications.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that was consciousness, then I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you take that vision, you'll get a lot of hunger.
I think that thinking about this, it tends to transform your <unk> whereas what it matters in ethical and moral terms, is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of information, it has a bit of complicated information processing so that the answer is, yes, it's conscious.
If this is right, they are very serious ethical problems about the challenges of the development of smart computers and the ethics of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the conscience of collective collective the planet.
Canada has its own <unk>
Or a more local level, a <unk> group like the audience at a TED Talk, at this point, we have a philosophical collective consciousness, a internal movie for this whole group of TED, different from the inner movies of every single <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question that needs to take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm really sure of the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing, which is a fundamental thing to be universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, a lot of challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're on the right way to a theory of serious consciousness.
If not, well, it's probably the hardest problem about science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we will finally find it.
Understanding consciousness is the key key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a little rural village in Victoria.
I had a very normal profile, an octopus in education.
I went to school, I was obsessed with my friends, I was obsessed with my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to interview him for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there is a problem with me.
She didn't do anything."
I went to school, I had good grades.
Yeah, I know. What a contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing to be considered as a achievement if we take the disability outside of the equation.
Years later, when I was in the second part of teaching in a high school school kid just after about 20 minutes in the middle of <unk> <unk> a guy raised her hand and said, "Hey, when you give your <unk>
And I said, "What <unk>
Well, I'd been talking about the law of <unk> for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your speech <unk>
When people on the wheelchair, they talk about things <unk> at school?"
Normally in the <unk> hall.
And then when I realized, this child had had experiences with disability with disability as <unk>
And we don't are. And it's not <unk> that is, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not real people. We are there to inspire us.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair wheelchair -- and you probably are waiting for you to ask you. Right?
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid I <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they have lied to us in relation to disability.
Yes, you've sold the lie that disability is something <unk> A capital capital <unk>
It's something bad and living with a disability makes you <unk>
It's not a bad thing, and it doesn't make a <unk>
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse -- <unk> <unk>
Or this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's plenty of them.
You may have seen one of the girl with no hands drawing with a pencil in the mouth.
You may have seen a child running with carbon fiber <unk>
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call <unk> <unk>
And I use the term porn <unk> because we <unk> a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, <unk> the <unk> in the benefit of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and think, "Well, bad than my life, it might be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that I've been <unk> <unk> to say that you think I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this was going on before my work had a public <unk>
It was like I was standing up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images are <unk> to people with disability for people without disability.
They're there for you to see you and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a hard thing.
Let's try some things.
But the things we overcome are not the things that you can think.
They're not bound to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> because I became aware of the so-called social model of disabilities, which tells us that we are more polite because of the society that we live because of our bodies or <unk>
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
The things I need to do, and I've learned how to get the best of your capacity as well as you do, and that's what happens to the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of common.
They are simply using their bodies taking the best of their ability.
So it's really fair to do that, in the way we do to share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it does.
It's because of the lie, because they've sold this lie that the disability makes us remarkable to us.
And honestly, it doesn't.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here -- inspiration and you think, "My God, you're not going to be inspired by anything?"
And I know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't think I'm lucky than them.
<unk> which is a great idea to use some <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that fall along --  <unk> the ingenious trick of how to upload the phone battery into the car battery in your chair.
Great.
We learn from force and resilience of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk> us.
I really think that that lie that has sold us about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us a hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in a range of stairs hasn't done it ever to become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> on a TV screen, I'm not going to make the <unk>
Neither a lot of people in the middle of a <unk> and a positive attitude to turn all those books to the <unk>
It's simply not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15-year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> don't consider any of anything for being on a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of people with disability that we are <unk> by getting out of bed and remembering our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of the people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child in 11 grade school is not a little bit surprised that his new teacher is a <unk>
The disability doesn't make us <unk> but questioning what you think to know about it.
Thank you.
What do you have to see augmented reality and professional football with <unk>
And what's the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today I'm just going to answer one of those questions, so please don't <unk>
When people think of really <unk> think of <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and to happen because we have the tools to do that, and people need to know, because augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I wear <unk> Google Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
I'll allow you to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I attempt <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you can relate to your imagination.
We can use the Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what is running through the <unk> <unk> of the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that you feel like a <unk> man <unk> trying to get away from everything that will be.
I've been there and I assure you it's not nice.
So I would take some videos to show you what is to use the Google <unk> under the helmet, and give them a sense of that.
Unfortunately, they're not images of the practices of <unk> because the idea of the <unk> of the emerging technology is a submarine rising up to the surface.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A moment I would start a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is to be <unk> in a soccer camp from the perspective of <unk>
You might have noticed that we lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Mice playing <unk>
Blue 8 <unk> Come on!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more to the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
The fans want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, be your favorite players and asked me on YouTube and <unk> <unk> you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we go from <unk> how we take it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which you probably know.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality, ever created, and it's not <unk>
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, long.
No, no, no, no! I don't want to keep <unk>
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
<unk> That's the experience of a man on a roller coaster in his life.
What will be the experience of a fan of <unk> when you <unk> a video of <unk> <unk> across the line, <unk> of a <unk> with the arm before he runs through and make a <unk> What's the experience of a fan of a fan.
When I can be <unk> running by the <unk> launching the ball to the back of the network? Or <unk> making a <unk>
What will be their experience when you walk from a mountain to more than 100 miles like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe it <unk> the <unk> for adults.
But this is not actually <unk>
It is just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get the reality <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality is augmented reality when the <unk> and the owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to gain.
They like to win. It gives you money.
So, here's a quick set of technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore had a <unk> on his field <unk> so it would play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> placed <unk> in the <unk> of the field <unk> and then in the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster.
In <unk> imagine that you are a player coming back to your group and you see their next slide you move in front of you, in a plastic show you're on <unk> you don't have to worry about to forget a <unk>
Or the strategy.
They just go into the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if you don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, and they hate <unk>
If you lose parties like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But <unk> reality is not just a manual of <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
How do you do that?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people on the bottom.
You also get information from the <unk> sensors and the <unk> something that's already been working.
And all that information is <unk> to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad guys will have <unk>
This <unk> the good teams of bad people.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and the data analysis to stop just to nerds.
It will be also for <unk> who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that you are the field <unk>
He would have the ball and <unk>
<unk> to a open receiver of a sudden a <unk> on the left of your bombsight will be told you that a defense behind you is going to be <unk> normally, you don't know," but the <unk> system will be <unk>
<unk> to the <unk> area.
Another <unk> you <unk> that there's an open receiver here.
<unk> the <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where you land, though, the receptor sees its bombsight as an area of grass that lights up and you can modify the race.
<unk> <unk> <unk> runs <unk>
The public <unk> and fans have followed each other from each angle.
This is something to create massive emotion in the game.
I'm going to do a lot of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it just as bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster the empathy between human beings, to show someone what it is, literally, being in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth for <unk>
It generates billions of dollars a year.
But how much is this technology for a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad are their actions from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it lives like being <unk>
How much for an <unk> <unk> or a Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science rather than <unk> and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is coming.
The questions we do and the choices we take and the challenges that we face, <unk> as always, of us.
Thank you.
I was talking about 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years ago, I spent the country on the southern end of <unk> County, which includes the Golden Gate bridge.
The bridge is an <unk> structure known for its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Indian Ocean and its architectural style of it.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most <unk> places in the world.
The Golden <unk> Bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> a head engineer who started building the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much test <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its <unk> of 1,600 people have jumped on their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers that will bring them to another dimension, and this bridge has <unk> as such, so that each of it frees you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a fall of four to five seconds, the body hits the water <unk> at about 120 miles an hour.
The shock of bone, a few of which would produce life <unk>
Most people die in the impact.
The one that doesn't normally be <unk> in the water and then <unk>
I don't think that those <unk> this method of suicide is to realize the death <unk> to the <unk>
This is the wire.
Except around the two towers, there's 32 inches of steel parallel to the bridge.
This is where most people were for before they had to take away from life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and at its darker moment, it's very difficult to bring you back.
I took this photo last year while this young man talked to a official looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had successfully successfully bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service of those who <unk> the suicide, but the officials as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, governments and psychologists train the new government today.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him at July 22 last year when I get a call from a possible blind subject sitting in the <unk>
<unk> and when I got there, he looked at Jason talking to a official <unk> player.
Jason had only 32 years old, and he had flown down here from New Jersey.
In fact, he had flown up here two times before from New Jersey to try to commit suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> I asked ourselves if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could <unk> and she opened the box.
And she came out <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped a few <unk> he leaned on to the right, and he left.
This guy and a very clever guy in New Jersey had just ever <unk> life.
I spoke to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, I didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi of the family called me to see what it was.
The parents of Jason had been order.
<unk> damage is affecting a lot of people.
I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family -- a friend or someone loved to be <unk>
What do you do?
What does that say?
In my experience, it's not just to speak, but you have to listen to.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> or say to the person who you feel, because you probably won't.
I just stand there, you can be the tipping point that you need.
If you think somebody is <unk> don't be afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way of asking you the question is: <unk> yourself in similar circumstances, have thought to end your life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of you can save life and be the turning point for them.
Other signs of <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and they're never going to say, <unk> believe that there is nothing that you can do to do to the <unk> social <unk> and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read your letter.
She lost her son on the 19 of January, this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and he was with his permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends that tell your friends, so forth.
I'm still pretty <unk> but noticing the most moments of realizing that Mike didn't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> game with her father 19 <unk>
He never got there.
I called the police of <unk> and <unk> it like disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officials came to my house and reported that the Mike car was down the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump up from the bridge to the <unk> of the last day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight themselves.
Who hasn't been wrong without having a real mental illness.
It shouldn't be so easy to end up with it.
My prayers are with you for your fight.
The <unk> the Golden <unk> Bridge is supposed to be a ticket, through our beautiful bay, a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and go through the path that his son took that day, and also the courage to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man who I mean with hope and value.
On April 11th, 2005, I replied a radio call by a possible subject known to the sidewalk nearby <unk>
<unk> my motorcycle <unk> and watched this man, Kevin <unk> on the sidewalk.
When he looked at me immediately the <unk> and he stopped at that little tube that goes around the tower.
Over the time and the half after, I heard as Kevin talked about her depression and despair.
Kevin decided for her account that day to go back on that lane and give her life another chance.
When Kevin <unk> I <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked her, "What was the thing that he made it <unk> and you gave the hope and life else <unk>
And you know what told me?
He said, "I <unk>
You stopped talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the Kevin, mom, and I have that card with me, and I'd like to <unk>
"Dear <unk> Mr. <unk> <unk> the events of <unk> and you're one of the reasons why Kevin follows with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it's been properly <unk>
<unk> to Kevin when I only had six months, totally unconscious of all those traits <unk> but thank God, we now know that.
Kevin is in order, as he says.
We take thank God for you.
Even in debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she writes <unk> When I visited the General General of San Francisco that night, you were going on as the patient.
<unk> I know I had to <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and an active member of society.
Talk about the events of that day and of her depression with the hope that their story will inspire others.
suicide is not just something that I've found in work.
It's personal.
My grandfather got infected with poison.
That act, despite the end of his own pain, the opportunity to meet him.
This is what suicide does.
For most people, or those who consider the suicide, they would not think of hurt another person.
They just want your own chronic pain.
Normally this is getting only three things: sleep, or alcohol or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and so-called suicide attacks.
So in those incidents that I've been standing directly involved, only have lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who told him about about an hour.
And during that time, I took my hand at three times.
In the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
It was absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people we get to the bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few that have jumped from the bridge, and lived and that you can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second you leave the railing realized they had made a mistake and wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connected to San Francisco, but also the people.
That connection, or bridge that we do is something that everybody and every one of us should be connected to doing.
<unk> can prevent.
There is help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but in your inside, you know what you are, and a question remains: How would you tell you?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone at all.
When I became a role model I felt finally had the dream that I had had since I was a child.
My outside <unk> I ended up with my inner truth, with my inner self.
By complicated reasons, why I'm going to go back later, when I look at this photo, I thought, you know, we did it.
But in October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm just starting.
We all love our families, our religion, our society, our time in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the <unk> value to get rid of the limitations of the skin or the beliefs of those of us.
These are people who always defy the status quo -- what's considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, a lot of my neighbors -- a lot of my friends, my agent, even ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called <unk>
This is mine.
I used to be used as <unk> at birth because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I would always wear this t-shirt on my head.
And my mom asked me, "Why do you always wear that t-shirt on the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, is something more complex and <unk>
Because of my success, I never encouraged myself to share my story, not because I would think that being a bad thing, but because of how the world comes to those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have mom, Dad and family who take me like I am.
Many are not so fortunate.
There's a long tradition of modern culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of the <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these puzzles.
I was standing in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman came to me, and I remember that moment as I was <unk> This is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was born with man, I met this woman named <unk>
It's the director of a <unk> competition.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you ever done on the <unk> <unk>
He told me that if I <unk> she was responsible for <unk> and <unk> and that night, I won in a bathroom suit, I won in <unk> and it was a third finalist among over 40 candidate
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first job was the queen of beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of the <unk> especially when he <unk> to <unk> <unk>
But more importantly, all of that, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom, who had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me that he passed my mind for the green card that I could go to live in the United States.
I was hooked.
I said to my mother, "Mommy, am I <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me up and said, "You know if you cling to America you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to listen to.
My mom suggested me to put two <unk> to my name.
She also stayed with me when I was in Thailand to the 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand do the <unk> surgeries and safer.
In that time in the United States, it was necessary to have surgery before changed, the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license with the name of <unk> and the gender <unk> <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means to be able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears were <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and to be a model.
Many are not so fortunate.
I think of this woman, <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was born, she lived his truth, but <unk> put her life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that you live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All 20 November, we do a global <unk> for the <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long story of people to <unk> and stood in front of injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth and just for me.
I want to do the best to help the other to live their truth without shame, no fear.
I'm here, <unk> for one day there is no longer any more <unk> of <unk>
My most profound truth led me to accept what I am.
You will you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.   <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> Sure. Of course, thank you first to thank my <unk>
To my network of support, to my parents especially, to my family, who actually is very strong.
I remember that I remember all the times I spent the young women who have been <unk> and some times, when they were called, and they told me that their parents could not embrace it. I took my mom and she called my mom and said, "Mom, you can call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked -- it's just the identity of gender, that's what's at the core of what we are, right?
I mean, we all assigned a gender at once, and what I try to do is put on the table the topic that sometimes the task is not a block and that should be a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still too much work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope you'll all be my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very <unk> Thank you.
In many hunter-gatherer societies, and tribal societies, the parents are usually known for their children, but I'm one of the few parents who knows her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> began his campaign for education by defending his rights in 2007. And when they <unk> their efforts in 2011, at the <unk> the National Prize <unk> became very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but I'm now his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of mankind, the history of women is the story of the <unk> of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies just from the very beginning, when when you're born, one girl, his birth is not <unk>
It's not welcome to her father and his mother.
The neighborhood comes up, it gives her mother and no one <unk> to the father.
And a mother got sick for a little girl.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first child, you get sad.
When it gives birth to the second child, they <unk> and with the hope of a child, when she was born, her third daughter, feels guilty like a criminal.
Not just the <unk> mother, but the daughter <unk> <unk> when she grew up, suffers as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, you get home and school would go home to the siblings.
Until 12 years, in a way, has a good life.
Can you imagine?
You can play with your friends on the street, and it can move around the streets as a butterfly.
But when it comes in adolescence, when it meets 13 years old, you let them get out of her house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the so-called honor of her father and her brothers and her family and her family, and if you were to <unk> the code of that one honor, the one could even kill.
And it's interesting that this <unk> of honor, is not only affecting the life of a <unk> it is also affecting the life of the male members of the family.
So this brother <unk> the joys of his life and the happiness of her sisters in the name of the God of course.
And there's a greater norm of <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl in which it should be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
That's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be quiet and accepts the choices of their father and mother and <unk> decisions even if they don't want.
If the <unk> with a man who doesn't like or if the <unk> with a old man has to <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> too young, he has to accept it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then give birth to more and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson from <unk> to his daughter and the same story of honor to her children.
And this vicious circle continues and it continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when he was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt so <unk>
And so much before I was <unk> I thought of his name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and he called my daughter to me.
But when I was concerned, all of these were men, and I grabbed my pen, and I would put a line from my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she died, when I was four and a half years in my school.
You might be wondering why should I mention a little girl in a school?
Yeah, I have to <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poorer countries, in the tribal societies, in tribal societies, is a great event for the life life.
<unk> in a school means recognition of his identity and her name.
One route to school means that it's entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for your future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when I was watching the form of a Canadian <unk> and was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was I had never seen the names of my sisters writing in any document.
That was the reason for my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and her daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends were coming to me.
The <unk> to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to focus on their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for <unk>
I've put all these good values back in my school to girls and boys alike.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught students, forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of calling <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, and more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
His name was <unk>
That means a complete denial of participation of women in all political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools.
The girls were banned at school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the age of 10, <unk> got up, and he rose up the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the blog of the BBC, he offered herself to the New York <unk> and talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It <unk> like a <unk> across the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban could not tolerate their campaign and nine in October of 2012, they were shot in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between my life and death, it was going to remind my wife to my wife -- "I wanted to hold her for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And he said, "Please, don't worry.
<unk> the only <unk>
<unk> your life in play because of the cause of peace, and because of the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and you <unk>
They were both on the right way and God <unk>
And these few words I would spend a lot to me, and I didn't ask you again.
When I <unk> I was in the hospital, and he had severe headaches and strong headaches because his facial <unk> was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used <unk> "I'm okay with my smile <unk> and with the <unk> on my face.
I'm going to put it right. Please don't <unk>
It was a solace for us, and we become angry.
<unk> brothers and sisters, we have learned from her how to resist the toughest moments, and I'm pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like every girl in 16 years.
<unk> when it doesn't end his task.
He fights with your siblings, and I'm very happy about that.
People ask me, "What is some special about my therapist who has done so audacious to <unk> so brave and expressive and <unk>
I mean, don't ask me what I did.
I don't know what I didn't.
I didn't cut your wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> by the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I am engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the <unk> group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the Google visualization -- but all the work I'm going to talk about today about the brain science, I did before I join Google or outside of my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you cling to a brain operation.
You're still as clever or not?
It's not going to be like that, you'll be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much they make, from more than a dozen powerful chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, it would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations and mix of chemicals, and try to <unk> them to stay alive.
More than once I've saved me.
But luckily, I have a <unk> soul for what I decided I would have to do to try and get the <unk> <unk> because there is really no map of what I call it in <unk>
I began to try and mix it together, and I was shocked to see how small changes in the passionate <unk> my <unk> my sense of who I am, my way to think, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months ago, I tried a <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk> and I was surprised to see how my thinking <unk>
I was always <unk> I thought all the time on sex, and I thought it was the most intelligent person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've met a number of guys like this, or maybe some <unk> <unk>
It turned out as an extreme.
But my big surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> so much <unk> fixing a problem that had the front, and it just wouldn't happen.
So I couldn't manage it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation about men and about what they have to do with -- since then I've been better with men.
What was trying to do is how to adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, I was to regain my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my thought -- my own ideas.
<unk> to think about the images, and that became my key point to how I can make those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if they were <unk> and new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thinking is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things differently.
They thought images and mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of arguments about how the mind works, for me, is a simple one, for most of us, mental images are fundamental to <unk> thinking.
So after a number of years, I had to find the point right and I have a lot of great <unk> mental <unk> really <unk> pretty sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to get these mental images of my mind to the screen of the computer.
Can you imagine what if a movie director would be able to use its imagination just to steer the world that has the way?
Or if a musician could extract the music of his head?
There are amazing possibilities with this, as the way that creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to achieve this is simply increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're fairly close to getting to this with two recent experiments that were done by two Jewish groups in neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology, functional magnetic space, to represent the brain. Here you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scanning of the brain of a person looking at an image.
The medium column shows you the scanning of the brain of that same individual as you were looking at that same image.
The column on the right is created <unk> the contents of the central column of the left, you see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is repeated in many different individuals with lots of different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same picture is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from Jack <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn brain waves into visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, it showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while <unk> their brains to create a large array of brain reactions in the video video.
And then I showed you a film with new images -- new people, new animals, and as long as they were <unk> a new <unk>
And the computer, using only the <unk> information to show what it looked like the person was seeing.
On the right, you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This let us <unk>
We're right near this.
We just need to get the resolution.
And now, remember, when you see an image and when you imagine that same picture, you create in the brain the same <unk>
This led to the brain scanning systems that are available today, and its resolution is a thousand times in the last few years.
We now need to increase the resolution of a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we do that?
There are a lot of techniques to do it.
One is opening up the skull and introduce electrodes.
I didn't offer you for that.
Many of them are proposing new projection techniques by images, even by me, <unk> with the recent outcome of the MRI -- first we need to ask the following, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get bigger resolution is with bigger magnets -- but at this point, magnets louder, only offer small improvements in the resolution, not the rise of thousands like we need to.
I propose this idea: rather than bigger magnets -- make better magnets.
We can create structures much more complex and <unk> like doing a <unk>
And why does this matter?
Over the last few years, a huge amount of effort in MRI were to make really big, right?
But the majority of the recent advances in <unk> and bright and bright and bright things on <unk> and <unk> in the slums, and <unk> user figures in the MRI systems.
At turn, instead of a magnetic field -- the magnetic field is <unk> <unk> magnetic patterns, which are linked to the frequencies of <unk> radius.
So by combining the magnetic patterns with the patterns of processing radio processing patterns, we can increase a massive form of information that you can extract in a single <unk>
Also, we can then split our growing knowledge of the structure of the brain and memory to create increase in the thousands we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not just the fluid <unk> but the hormones and <unk> that I mentioned and maybe even the direct neural activity is sleep.
We're going to be able to put our ideas in a direct shape to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go over the language and communicate directly by the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are big questions.
It would be <unk> to use as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication.
Indeed, this tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's disease and similar disease.
We have a few options that will open up this door.
Anyway, choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take a lot more.
We need to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to tell you tonight about getting out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay sense.
I think we all have <unk>
Your missionary may be saying to some person for the first time that the love or saying someone who is pregnant, or to tell someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation for that one is happening in life.
So all together is a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived in, and I'll have come out of that hall is a universal thing.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
Several years ago, I was working in the South Side <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and there was a restaurant in the city, and I was there, I had to go through a bunch of <unk> on the intensity of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk>
And to be slope for the <unk> of my <unk> and I got my head through my head -- I would ask myself a little boy -- "Hey, would you be a kid or <unk>
And it would appear a awkward silence at the table.
<unk> my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a little <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother tossed a cold look at his son.
But I would not say anything, and <unk> it.
And I came to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself the next time I would say something.
I should have that tough conversation.
So after a few weeks, I came up again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time was <unk> and I was about to come from filled with the female issues at the table.  He was the cartoon of Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a piece of the "Vagina Monologues," I was able to <unk>
So I took a deep breath, and I went down and I went down and my backs -- a four-year-old girl with a dress of dress, staring at it, which is not a challenge for a surrogate <unk> just a little girl with a question: "You're <unk>
So I took a deep breath, and I got out of <unk> around her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is a little bit confusing.
I have the short hair like a boy, and I watched <unk> but I'm a girl, and you know, like you like to wear a dress and pink, and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
Now, I'm more than a girl in a <unk>
And that girl looked at me <unk> and he said, "My favorite pajamas is <unk> and he has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was it. Just "Ah! <unk> You're a girl.
What about the <unk> that we <unk>
It was the hardest conversation of all that I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, two, we were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside the dark, you can't know what color are the walls.
You just know how one feels like it feels like a <unk>
That's how my missionary is not different from your or yours or yours.
<unk> will give you a hundred reasons why coming out of my life, it was harder to get out of his, but this is the <unk> it's hard to be <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that to explain to somebody who has declared them on bank <unk> it's harder than to say it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is harder than saying to your child five year-old child who are going to be <unk>
There's no more difficult thing, just there's the tough thing.
We need to stop classifying what it is hard to do with how hard for someone else to make us feel better or worse in relation to our peers, and we need to only feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what they are made out of your walls, a living, not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine the same 20 years ago.
I had a horse, one dress of horse -- a dress of <unk>
It wasn't the militant lesbian <unk> to fight any child from four years to go into the coffee.
I was frozen because of the fear of mine, <unk> in a corner of my <unk> <unk> my <unk> gay, and move only a muscle is the <unk> thing I've ever done.
My family, my friends, full strangers I have spent my entire life trying to <unk> and now the world turned back into purpose.
He was burning the pages of a script that we all have followed for so long, but if you don't throw that <unk> to kill you.
One of my most memorable <unk> was in my sister's wedding.
It was the first time that many of the guests knew that it was gay, and when I did my <unk> <unk> in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally come to one where the friends of my parents, people who knew me <unk>
And after talking about a moment, one of the women shouted, <unk> Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
<unk> you ever were in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard it's <unk>
<unk> you meet my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and I've never talked about having <unk>
What is your favorite TV show.
Our classic <unk> Will Grace <unk>
And you know who <unk> us?
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but in hopes to show her support, to get me to know that I was on my side, he finally said to me, "Well, sometimes my husband is wearing <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as you have all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic <unk>
This is how hard conversations remain without my strong point.
Ask anyone who I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I keep what I call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay <unk> but understand that what it means to go out of any closet is essentially the same.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee had no towel, but I was ready for battle.
If you want somebody to be <unk> others need to know that we do suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> Just <unk> <unk> his <unk>
If you know that they're gay, <unk>
If they say to your parents that maybe they might be gay, they will keep the hope that that could change.
Don't give them a sense of hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex stuff.
You communicate your truth.
I would never get upset about that.
And some of you may go out permanently <unk> so they have done, but I'm never comfortable with what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you might feel <unk> but that stuff in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your <unk>
That's the story of them, but not you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So next time you find yourself in a dark way, <unk> a <unk> must know that we've all been there before.
And you might feel very sick but they don't.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> what is that?
If you look at the history of how intelligence, an intelligence has been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think of is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a critique of computer <unk> like Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, I would take a program to try and understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Get a walk.
We first start with a thought experiment.
Imagine that you are from a <unk> race that you know nothing about the biology of the Earth or the <unk> of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason we are trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that you don't know anything about this, which doesn't have any concept about intelligence on Earth, you would see how, to a certain point in time, the asteroids that are <unk> the surface of a planet planet, let them stop doing it.
And that's why I claim that this is the same question that to understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led several years ago, I studied a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that I <unk> I think, to a single underlying information underlying intelligence.
In <unk> for instance, there's been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be able to be able to be able to be able to evolve to the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that <unk> the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the planning planning, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so taking all these different subjects and <unk> together, I asked her, I asked you for several years now, there's an underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
Is there just a equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're looking at is probably the closest equivalent to one and = <unk> for intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're looking at here is a claim that intelligence is an strength, F, that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keeping the online options with a force T, with the diversity of potential future <unk> Yes, to an impending future, <unk>
In a nutshell, the intelligence doesn't like to be <unk>
intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and maintaining open choices.
And so, having in account this equation, it's natural to ask: "What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the level of human <unk>
<unk> intelligence <unk>
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology has suggested that universes that produce more <unk> or <unk> during their life should be a tendency to be more favorable to the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually comes directly from her?
To find out, we developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy and long-term entropy in any system where you can find it.
Amazingly, <unk> was able to spend multiple trials of animal intelligence, to play human games, and even make money <unk> actions, all of it without the one that had been wrong to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a <unk> person, here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave them a goal.
He just decided for his own account to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance is going to have applications for blood robotics and human care technology.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing, and agriculture.
Also, like some other animals can cooperate pulling up on the edges of a string at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can make a model of the model of that task.
This ability of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For instance, here we see successfully playing a game playing against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
Here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where the friends are continually <unk> and they are constantly keeping the net wide <unk>
This same capacity of network <unk> also has applications in health care, and energy and energy.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of boats, discovering with success and using the Panama Canal, to expand the world from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable with problems in <unk> and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and running a <unk> strategy of <unk> <unk> on a simulated array of action, successfully increased assets under their economic recovery.
This risk of risk will have enormous applications in finance, and in secure.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is a variety of human cognitive behaviors, such as the use of tools, to walk upright and social cooperation -- all driven from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize its future freedom of action.
Now, here is a deep <unk>
Let's go back to the beginning of the term -- the <unk> play, there was always the concept that if we were <unk> intelligent machines, there would be a secret <unk>
Machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of the rebellion <unk> in reverse.
It's not that machines first become smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all other opposite, that the impulse to take all the future of all the possible future is a very fundamental principle that the human intelligence can actually arise directly from taking control, instead of going to be the other way around.
Another important consequence is the pursuit of the target.
And often they ask me, how do you look for goals be <unk> from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to pass the descendants to help you build artificial artificial artificial artificial artificial artificial artificial intelligence, is the following: <unk> must be a view of a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the <unk> of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Except, in the last few years, we've expanded our knowledge of how it fits Earth in the context of the universe.
The Kepler Kepler has discovered thousands of potential planets orbiting other stars, which points to the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope which measures the intensity -- faint of the stars when the planets go through them, and they randomly implant a little bit of that light that we're going to go.
The data came out of Kepler showing the sizes of the planets besides the distance and their mother.
And together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the land of our solar system, and also the amount of light that get out of their own.
At the time, this gives you clues about whether these planets we find are <unk> or not.
Unfortunately, as we are finding this trove of fictional worlds, our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
On the year 2014, was the <unk> profile.
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us since millennia, are now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale, have outperformed our ability to alter their course.
But I'm not a weather scientist in the weather, nor <unk>
I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as a very interested in the search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for Earth-like planets like Earth, as far as our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the planet and discovered the planets that we know better -- our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a bit farther away from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world that has a <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been <unk> in the past and, in part, that's why we studied so much on Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> are tracking its surface in search of the origins of life as we know it.
<unk> like the <unk> mission, they take samples from the <unk> atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Local companies now offer not only short flights but also the <unk> possibility of living on Mars.
But even though all these <unk> images remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with ideas that are linked in comparison with the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the cortical areas on our planet that still stay with <unk> places that are really consistent with Mars.
Even in the most sacred and higher places of the Earth is fresh and full of oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement for the colonization of Mars, and other planets will tell you a great and sad challenge of the implication, and the belief that Mars are waiting for us to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that it's truly <unk> Earth.
For a long time I like exploration exploration, I'm deep disagreement with this idea.
There are lots of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to help humanity is like imagine that the captain of the Titanic will tell us that the <unk> actually has a place later in the <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for operational exploration, and the preservation of earth is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding and to improve life in the future.
The extreme environments here in our world look like <unk>
They're just getting closer home.
If we can understand how to create and sustain spaces that are hostile and <unk> spaces of the land, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with an experiment by <unk> the paradox of <unk>
Many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi knew, by realizing that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of the existence of alien life until now.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced enough to consider to keep living between the stars, they lose the notion of what's important that is protecting the origin of the planets that have this development.
It's arrogant to think that only colonization, <unk> will save us from ourselves, but planetary preservation and exploration, can be working together.
If we really believe in our ability to think of the underlying environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own home.
And as I was on the front porch and staring at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were on the dining room where I had <unk>
So I quickly tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all very closed off.
I thought I'd call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get there, and it was cold.
I couldn't go home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had a flight in Europe in the next morning, and I got my passport and my bag.
<unk> expensive, but sure that they were not more expensive than a <unk> at a half a night, so I thought, despite the circumstances, living well.
I'm a <unk> a profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> who increases the heart rate, and the level of adrenaline and <unk> the thinking.
And when I got to the counter counter at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that could be done, systems that I could put in place that I think would be bad things.
Or at least if it happens, it's bad things, that you will notice the probability of a total <unk>
So I started thinking about that, but until a month after my thoughts I <unk>
I was sitting with my colleague, Danny <unk> winner of the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed he told him that I broke the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared a little bit with me that I had been practicing something called <unk>
It's something he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written about this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
Everybody knows what the <unk> is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come up and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
On the <unk> like it explains <unk> you look forward and tries to figure out all the things that could go wrong, then tries to figure out what it can do to prevent things or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you is some things we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not as evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
Back in the house, you buy a place for things that are <unk> very easily.
This sounds common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There is a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a track of the location of the important things, where the fish are, that the fish that are <unk> where the female trees are living where women and friends are <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows you to find their nuts.
And if you ask if somebody did actually did the experiment, they cut the sense of <unk> and they could still find their nuts.
They didn't use smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move a lot, not so good for things that are moving so much.
This is the reason for losing <unk> reading and <unk>
So at home, you buy a place for the keys, a hook next to the gate, maybe a <unk> dish.
For your passport. <unk>
For your glasses of reading, a particular <unk>
If you take a place and you're <unk> with it, your stuff will always be there when you <unk>
What about <unk>
Take a picture of your credit cards a picture of your credit card card, <unk> <unk> for mail to be in the cloud.
If these things miss or <unk> this can be <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thinking.
So part of the <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we're not going to be at the best time, and you need to put the systems on the site.
And there are perhaps not more <unk> situation than when you're faced with a medical decision.
And at some point, we all will be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or the one will be dear, to help you with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of us in medical decisions, and in fact for making financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that we need to take from the fact that we would be a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the physician says, "I have a result of the lab and your cholesterol <unk>
Everybody knows that high-level cholesterol is associated with a higher risk of heart disease, heart attack, brain <unk>
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the physician says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And you may have heard of the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today are even likely to know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, is a statistic that you should ask for the majority of the doctors who don't want to talk about, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number we need to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or having surgery in any medical procedure before you can help a person.
And you have to think about what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor won't tell me whether not to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not fault of the doctor, and if it's fault of somebody, it's scientists like me.
We haven't understood very well <unk> mechanisms.
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs works only about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number we need to treat the most widely <unk> what do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before you can help a person?
300.
This according to the research of the researchers on the cynical <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently by <unk>
I just explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the medicines for a year before avoiding a heart attack, stroke brain or another <unk> event.
Now you might think, "Well, one chance in 300 of my <unk>
Why don't you <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistical statistic and is, <unk> the <unk> effects.
For this particular drug, the side effects produced by five percent of the patients.
And those include things -- <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain <unk> but now they think, <unk> five percent is not very likely to pass it to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
Remember that under stress don't think clearly.
So think about how to do this with the time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 have the side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get <unk> by the drug that you can help you.
I don't say you should or don't take the <unk>
I just say you have to have this conversation with your physician.
The medical ethic is required, it's part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air on the value of the crash, but actually this number we need to deal with is quite typical.
For the surgery, which is more done in the greatest men of 50, prostate cancer, the number of necessary to treat is <unk>
This is, 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case are produced in 50 percent of the patients.
Those include <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent only <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think earlier before the questions that you can argue that you will take the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this in the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a lot of times a lot of times, you want a shorter life of pain, or a longer life that might have a lot of pain towards the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about now, with their family and loved ones.
You can change gears on the heat of the time, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, one of the things that happens at that moment is that they turn out a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face face-to-face with a predator -- you don't need the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism into those things, it doesn't react quickly. They could get to be the lions, so none of it matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is <unk> <unk> as Danny <unk> and his colleagues have been shown.
So we have to <unk> to think about the future to these kinds of situations.
I think what's important here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail to <unk>
The idea is to think about the future how they might be these <unk> to put the systems in the place that will help you minimize harm, or to prevent things bad at the first place.
<unk> on the night of snow in <unk> when I returned from my journey, my contractor set up a combination of a combination next to the gate, with a key to the entry door on the same way, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't ordered and lots of messages that I haven't read about.
So I'm not very <unk> but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite musical song.
It means <unk> <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to touch it harder.
Two <unk> even more smoothly.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree tree, and you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can come to be never fully <unk>
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound of <unk>
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system of signs, the <unk> in addition to my own history.
The French language of French signs came over the decade of 1800, and over time, mixed with local, and developed the language that we know as <unk>
So, it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize that it's not true for anything.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a <unk> world is like I lived in a foreign country, following their rules, <unk> behaviors and <unk>
So how do you understand the <unk>
Well, I see how people behave and they respond to sound.
People are like <unk> and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I learned, for example.
"Don't <unk> the <unk>
Don't do a lot of noise to eat from <unk> <unk>
"Not <unk> and when you're eating it, you didn't get the covered in the <unk>
This is what I call <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the label of sound more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk> of the sounds.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, which is going to come next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> <unk>
Let's go ahead and go on.
<unk> by <unk>
You can see that the <unk> doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the <unk> subtle and <unk>
<unk> culture is equivalent to the sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, for me, to do this with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings I only have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic <unk> there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized there was no visual art there.
At that time, sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art -- it was all <unk>
Now sound has come into my field of art.
Is it going to be <unk>
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it's not just through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to inform sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And all that had me taught me in the sound of sound, I decided to leave it and be <unk>
I started to create a new job of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck by the quantity of support and <unk>
I realized that sound is like money, power, <unk> social <unk>
In the back of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> was a little listener.
And the sound is so powerful that I could be able to impress me and my artistic work, or I could help me.
I chose to <unk>
There's a massive culture around speech.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me like and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in work and institutions, I work with lots of different <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for <unk> their voices, I am able to keep a temporary form of value as well as to take a loan to a very high interest rate.
If we wouldn't continue with this practice, I feel that I could blame in the forget and not have any social value.
So with the sound as my new artistic medium -- I was born in the world of music.
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note can't capture and completely express in the paper.
And the same thing can be said of a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much as the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you understand how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> divide into lots of different <unk>
If you <unk> a <unk> for each finger while it touches the piano, like facial expression -- the <unk> movement -- the shape of your hand, and so as it plays the piano, the English is a linear language, as if you will, just a <unk> at once.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need 10 fingers in a place to express a clear concept, or a idea of <unk>
If only to change the <unk> it would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing happens with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different parameters, you can express different ideas.
For example, the <unk> signal in that."
This is the <unk> sign on that."
Am I'm looking at.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk> me.
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at the <unk> through <unk> <unk>
If I had to create a sign and put it over and over again, it might be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the <unk> sign -- the sun comes out and you <unk>
This is <unk>
If you take it off, and you get the speed, visually <unk> you see as a piece of music.
The whole day.
I feel the same thing can be said by <unk> the <unk>
"All <unk>
This is all night on this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I feel the third one has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time they express time in <unk> and how distance your body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present is closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the same time, <unk> a <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rhythm of four times by <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically at <unk> same time."
Look at <unk> <unk> right <unk>
We have the <unk> through your head and <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Can you do with me?
All of the hands at top.
Now we're going to do it both in your head like the chest, which is like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, very good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and language languages worldwide.
The second one that I'd like to show you is this. Please do it over me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please give me again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
Let's do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and <unk> but they make very different changes.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> live and lived just like music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because <unk> doesn't have sound, it doesn't have social value.
We need to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to grow its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more inclusive society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn <unk> and you have to hear about learning music.
<unk> is a <unk> wealth and I'd like you had the same experience.
I'd like to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience of our visual language.
And you never know, you can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents said to me, "You can do everything, but then you have to <unk>
The freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in an innocence of innocence or a bubble of ignorance -- I should say, because adults were dying to protect us from the awful truth.
When I get older, I first learned that adults also <unk> and they're not very good to clean the others.
The time is, now I'm an adult and teach citizenship and invention in <unk> <unk>
You don't have to wait a lot for my students to walk around the beach with lots of waste.
So as good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, they're not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but today more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big oil and networks, to collect these plastic chunks to study under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use those huge <unk>
So along with my students, with six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We begin to build this <unk> <unk> work so that the kids are very <unk> they can also participate.
And I'll tell you the kids that manipulate power tools feel great and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and reduce it to the size that we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
We do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to figure out something we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting plastic chunks just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the kids would get together a lot with the robots.
And then we also created what we call "a <unk>
We are so fast in creating prototypes that ended up before lunch.
And we transform light camera and chambers in a <unk> robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see the little bits of plastic floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board process this picture, and measure the size of each <unk> to get an estimate of plastic in the water.
And I had this invention step at a step on a website to inventors called <unk> with the hope that somebody else hated it, even more.
The cool thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and they're trying to be trying to answer it immediately.
I'm trying to investigate my <unk> but my students in Hong Kong are very good kids.
Do you see the news, <unk> the Internet, and it <unk> with this <unk>
A child, maybe less than 10 years old, cleaning a oil spill, just using the hands, in <unk> the world's largest <unk> in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water where the water <unk> the water where they live.
You can also see that water is brown and the mud and the oil are also <unk> and when everything is <unk> it's very difficult to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> that can be <unk> through all sorts of product that produce <unk> which can help identify what is in the water.
So let's put this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The cool thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help in remote shape to other children.
I tried to investigate a problem at <unk> and I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further, maybe to address a more difficult problem, and it's also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French and probably remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that he took a bunch of giant waves called <unk> and these <unk> destroy various cities on the coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant in Fukushima, a nuclear nuclear space near water.
And today, according to the average reports of 300 metric tons are still leaking out of the nuclear plant in the Pacific.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has <unk> <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure radiation radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it looks like the majority of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, and most of the time, is safe, it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the accident and independently independently with other scientists, the land, and this time we wanted to take the kids.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't get it.
But every night we went to the center of <unk> here you see the use of <unk>
It might seem like they didn't take work seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all their life.
Together with them we discussed <unk> data, that day and we talked about what we were going to do next, <unk> <unk> etc.
And to do this, we create an <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> <unk> to represent real-time data in real time of <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
We were able to notice that the dust that's going to be <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> <unk>
But based on this we organized an civil expedition, the nearest to the nuclear power to date.
We can zoom down to a mile of the nuclear company, and with the help of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea floor with a little tracker of sediment as we invent and build it.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem, to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple technology.
But at the same time, it's increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even begun trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways of doing all these things.
So the classroom became so much so small so we found an industrial facility in Hong Kong and we turn it into the greatest space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's at the center of Hong Kong -- and it's a place where we can work with wood metal, chemistry -- a little bit of biology, fibers, you can just build almost everything.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become a reality of adults, and where adults can be kids again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with energy.
For example.
Or, well, we can help in the mobility of how old life will transform their standard wheels <unk> into new self-driving vehicles.
plastic, oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our kids are lies.
We cannot afford to protect the children of the horrible truth, because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So citizen scientists, we know, we should prepare the next generation to be concerned about the environment and people, and so that they can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two radically opposite cultures.
One is made out of thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of a silk <unk>
One of them is <unk> the other organic one.
One is <unk> over the environment, the other one would ever understand.
One is designed by nature, the other by it.
Miguel <unk> said that when he looked at the <unk> in <unk> he saw a figure that will be free.
The <unk> was a single tool of Michelangelo.
But living things are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, we have all the information required for every cell to work and to work it.
The tools have also consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> and mass production.
<unk> lines have dictated a world made of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think of their objects, like <unk> parts of different things with different functions.
But you don't find any <unk> material in nature.
Think about the human skin, for example.
Our facial <unk> are thin with electromagnetic <unk>
<unk> of the back is more thick with little <unk>
You act primarily like a <unk> the other mostly as a barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there is no <unk> there's no <unk>
It's a system that is gradually gradually gradually through the variation of <unk>
Here's a broken screen, which represents my view of the world -- the double personality of every designer and an architect to work today between <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the organism and the organism between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right and the <unk> and <unk> shows in two screens after me.
My job in their simplest level, it tries to bring these two visions of the world, moving from the assembly and approaching growth.
You probably wonder, why now?
Why wasn't it possible about 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment where we have four disciplines that offers designers access to tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I <unk>
Please meet the minds and my students' hands.
We design objects, products, structures and tools through large-scale scales, like this robotic arm with an order of diameter with a <unk> base that some day not very distant and print buildings and graphics and nanoscale <unk> <unk> genetically altered <unk>
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and it's created a screen where each aperture is just size to shape the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> This was for a fashion fashion <unk> which is <unk> van <unk> It's like a second skin made of one piece, <unk> in the <unk> flexible around the waist.
<unk> with <unk> 3D printing -- we print this layer and <unk> 3D <unk>  I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid materials and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a functional MRI.
That designers have access to this analytical analytical resolution, and the <unk> instruments allows you to design products that <unk> not just the shape of our bodies, but also the <unk> structure of our tissues.
We've also designed an acoustic <unk> chair to the very symmetrical and also that absorbs sound.
Professor Carter -- my collaborator, we went back to the nature of <unk> and by designing this pattern of a <unk> surface surface becomes <unk>
We put up this surface of 44 different properties which vary in <unk> and color, <unk> the dots in the human body.
His surface, as in nature, they vary its functionality not by addition to another material or another <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk> the material property.
But it's the <unk> nature.
There's no parts of nature?
I was not raised in a religious <unk> but when I was young, my grandmother told me the stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me and got to define a lot of what I care about.
As she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> tree <unk>
For that first <unk> tree there would be no difference between <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
The whole tree was a fruit.
Instead, the land made rise trees with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The earth created a world made of parts.
I often ask, "What would the design if the objects were made of a single piece?
<unk> a better state of <unk>
So we looked for the material -- the kind of material on the tree of the tree with fruit, and we found it.
The second <unk> most abundant on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons produced every year by organisms like shrimp, crab, <unk> and <unk>
We thought that if we could tune through your properties, we could generate structures that were used in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> legal.  We did a bunch of <unk> <unk> <unk> and produced toothpaste.
<unk> the chemical concentrations we've been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to the light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures that was built into a system with multiple <unk> of <unk> <unk>
The robot could actually vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made of a single material 3.5 meters long, 100 percent.
When the pieces are ready, they let them dry up to find a natural shape to contact with air.
So why are we now designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process used to contain <unk> <unk> which appeared for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, we heard it yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the genetically engineered bacteria to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere, and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition out of urine and <unk> and if it grows even longer, even windows.
A pink tree, <unk> fruit.
Working with an old material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a <unk> structure of shrimp in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best <unk> for objects designed to <unk> put in the sea, <unk> the <unk> life and placed on the ground, they'll grow a tree.
The fit for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep the life for <unk>
To do that, we need to master bacteria and control their flow.
So as the <unk> <unk> we did our own <unk> <unk> new forms of life, made <unk> made of biological form.
I like to think of synthetic biology as the liquid <unk> just that instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> new narratives in very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these degraded crops.
In our first piece of clothes, <unk> two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
He lives in our oceans, and in the fresh water.
And the second E. <unk> the bacteria <unk> in the human intestine.
One makes light light in sugar, and it produces biofuels and produce useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think about it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution per design.
And to contain these relationships, we have created a single channel that looks like the tract <unk> that will help you bring these bacteria and to make it easier for the road.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of the material according to <unk>
If we wanted to get more <unk> we got more transparent channels.
This <unk> system, when you stretch out of an extreme another, it takes 60 meters.
This is half the length of a soccer camp and 10 times more than our very weak intestine.
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> <unk> shiny channels with life within the clothing.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are <unk> creatures, <unk> only half is <unk>
What if design would make the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the matter.
And if we could create personal <unk> that we <unk> our skin <unk> the tissue destroyed and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of editing biology.
I call this the material ecology.
To do that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now, you know that a 3D printer printed material in layers.
It also knows that nature doesn't make it like that.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture -- a home inside which is <unk>
<unk> manufacturing is about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of two materials, but of two protein in different <unk>
One is acting as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, <unk> those fibers to each other.
And this happens through the scales.
<unk> worm first goes into the environment, creates a structure of tension, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of a silk worm at <unk>
We put it inside a box with infrared sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the <unk> of the worm.
However, when I place the silk worm in a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that they <unk> a long, flat coffee, still <unk>
So we started to design different parts of different <unk> and we've discovered that the shape, composition, the <unk> structure will be transmitted directly by the environment.
They often <unk> the silk worms to death in their <unk> their silk is <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these <unk> we could shape the benign silk without boiling a single <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we got this process to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making <unk> and we put it on our site.
We knew that the silk worms are attached to more dark areas and <unk> so we use a solar road diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat into our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays of the light and the heat -- distributes that silk worms over the structure.
We were prepared to get the <unk>
We asked <unk> tube worms, silk <unk>
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to <unk> with us.
We put them carefully on the lower edge of the <unk> and as they were <unk> <unk> they <unk> <unk> <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
By <unk> biological silk on the silk <unk> they give up this whole pavilion its integrity.
And in little more than two or three weeks, <unk> worms -- <unk> <unk>
A curious symmetry, this is also the length of the <unk> route.
The <unk> after <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions in the world.
A <unk> silk is by a robotic arm, the other full <unk>
If the last frontier of design is to give the products and the buildings around us, to form a new ecology, the designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which leads us to turn, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which leads to a <unk> inspired nature to an inspired nature in design, which demands us for the first time, we make ourselves in charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever asked them, "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they asked this?
You can spray it with toes.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if you ask the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
It's caused some kind of anxiety.
Whatever anxiety.
I'm somebody who never could answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem was not that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked the English and <unk> and the art and went on the website, and I was playing a guitar in a punk band, called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard of us.
And generally I like to try and persist anyway, because we have spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time this feeling of, this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it gets to <unk>
And I have to give up.
But then I transferred to me for something else, something completely different, and I would focus on it, and I let myself absorb and I feel <unk> I've found <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it out.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This caused me very much anxiety for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this whole thing into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, denying all my other passions and <unk> them to <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong about this, and something bad about me for nothing.
I was worried to be afraid of engagement, or to be careful, or to <unk> or to my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to have been given then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where you <unk> they learned about the culture.
So we asked you first, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that no one cares about what it would happen to that age.
This is considered a naive question to cause nice answers in the children like, <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question is going to happen over and over again as we grow in a different forms, <unk> <unk> to high school students are the question you're going to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute little exercise before you take the dream.
Why?
If this question inspired children to dream with what might be, is not inspired by dreaming of anything you might be.
In fact, just the opposite, because when somebody asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though adults are likely to be <unk> and say, "Oh, what's cute, but you can't be a <unk> <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  And he's <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this <unk> <unk> publisher he turned into <unk> and <unk> and creative <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life <unk> is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of the fate or the real <unk> the idea that each of us has something to do with your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is, and spend your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected to this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that show their curiosity and lots of different things that wants to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feeling something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong in you.
Is it a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with many interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk> to say.
Could you help if you divide it into three <unk> multiple potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms to <unk> the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the age of the Renaissance, the ideal was who I was <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
<unk> any term you like or your <unk> your own.
It seems like a kind of playful to a community, we cannot agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> as limitation or woe you must win.
But what I've learned by talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, which is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here's three superpowers here.
One: the synthesis of ideas.
That is, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in cartography, mapping and mathematics and design, when I found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates <unk> <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea for its <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
So there is new ideas.
And <unk> with all their background, can access a lot of these <unk> points.
The second superpower, <unk> is hard learning.
When we put them into something, we go to that.
We see everything we can have in our hands.
We are used to <unk> because I've been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we are less afraid of testing new things and get out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything we've learned to each new zone that we use, so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a full-time <unk> and <unk>
As a child who was <unk> an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest known <unk>
Before I become a writer, <unk> was financial <unk>
He had to learn the deepest sales of sales when it was starting their benefit, and this ability helps to write compelling launches for the editors.
<unk> it's rarely a waste of time to get to what you would love it, even if you get it <unk>
Is it possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower, <unk> is adaptability. It means the ability to transform anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the director of videos, other designer from pages -- sometimes jazz <unk> sometimes <unk> and, sometimes, James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He is even more valuable because it can take diverse <unk> depending on the needs of their clients.
The <unk> Magazine Magazine defined adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so fast and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be <unk> to meet the market needs the ones that are really <unk>
<unk> of ideas -- quickly learning and <unk> three abilities where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that you could lose if they're fighting to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to do in front of them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> of the belly knowing because they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams make a physician and a <unk> <unk>
<unk> can dive deep and put in practice, ideas, and <unk> provides a span of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that relate to the way we're connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in a lot of them are being told to be more like their fellow <unk>
I once said that, if there is one thing that you take from this talk, I hope that's this: <unk> with internal wiring -- whatever it is.
If you are a heart, then you get through all the media.
That's where you get the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just noticed being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with your very many passions.
Keep your curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
It ruins the intersections.
<unk> our internal <unk> it leads us to a nicer and happy life.
And perhaps the most important thing, we <unk> the world to us.
Thank you.
In the year I went to a woman named <unk> who took a psychiatric <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of their life.
His doctor called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her, unfortunately, passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and found strange dishes and <unk> in the <unk> brain of a guy who had never seen before.
Even more surprising.
If we were going to have been living today, we couldn't even give her the more aid that he was given to her <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to receive a diagnosis that we now call heart disease.
From <unk> medicine has moved so much.
They've discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the <unk> lots of treatments for cancer, selling it for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But gradually it's made progress on Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists working to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million worldwide.
But by 2050, it's going to affect 150 million which, by the way, to include a lot of you.
If you wait to live to the 85 years or more, the possibility for Alzheimer's disease will be almost one of every two.
In other words, there is the probability that you spend your years or Alzheimer's disease or helping care of a friend or dear Alzheimer's disease.
It's only in the U.S., it's about 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of healthcare is spent on Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs -- a <unk> increase in the year by 2050, as the generation of the <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's one of the biggest doctors and social challenges of our generation.
But it has relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death all over the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that can be <unk> cure or even slow their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we spend less time and money on the research.
The United States government spends 10 times more every year in the cancer research that in Alzheimer's disease despite the fact that it costs more Alzheimer's and causes a similar annual number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, lack of consciousness.
Because this is what few people knows, but everybody kills it: Alzheimer's is a disease, we can <unk>
For most of the last few years, for most of the last few years, all of us, even, scientists, Alzheimer's Alzheimer's aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal part of aging.
But there is only a picture of a <unk> brain, compared to a disease Alzheimer's to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to trigger a severe loss of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's cost, to significantly greater life expectancy and is always <unk>
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found tectonic and <unk> <unk> in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know much about this.
We know today that are made out of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds into an origami.
There are places on the paper that are <unk>
And when we <unk> well, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> dots stay on the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There's a lot of steps, and identifying what step next is complex, as <unk> a bomb.
<unk> a wire could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb bomb.
You have to find the right step of the <unk> and then create a drug that does.
Until recently, in its most part of the wires and you would expect the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> chemicals, physicists and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. This is now testing a new type of drugs that are blocking specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our latest results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at a few videos of what happened to prove these drugs in <unk>
These are the <unk> <unk> and you can see it moves with normal.
These worms on the other hand, have molecules of protein that stick each other inside them, like Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs these worms at a very early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just one positive initial outcome but research as this sample that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there is real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to bridge that hope, from overcoming Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to make sure that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we fix it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, the patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, drug industry and <unk>
That was essential to advance the HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to defeat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the messy victims of their loved ones and night, they're often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not about most cases a genetic disease.
The whole world with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients today, and they cannot create the change they need for themselves.
They were talking about them, and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
This article in the <unk> <unk> in New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with someone, do this.
The article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and of my own experience to test it. I was a night last last year.
So the procedure is quite simple: -- two strangers will be <unk> to get 36 and more personal questions and then both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions here.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, what would you be?
Number four: When was the last time you ever met.
And <unk>
In fact, these are more personal and more personal.
Number <unk> really asks me to love your partner what you like to you, or she was very honest about this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say somebody who has ever met.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a very supportive detail that I really got the attention to me about it, the exhilaration that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had the occasion of testing this study, with someone I knew not particularly good, I didn't expect to <unk>
However, we <unk> and -- and I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the neocortical column in a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already -- so I guess some of you probably ask, are they going on, they go together.
And the reason I believe this is because I've done this question over and over again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to that.
A week before the article was published was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had asked myself to write about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog blog can get to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just from my friends on Facebook and imagined that my article in the New York Times is probably a few thousand <unk>
And that took a good attention to a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The article was published on a Friday at night, and he Saturday, this occurred in my blog.
And the <unk> had already been called <unk> Show and "Good <unk>
In a month, the article received more than eight million pages, and I was, by saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster the confidence by writing with individual experiences, but another thing is to find that the loving life of one has been an international news --  and that people all over the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people were called or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, always, they were doing the same question: still together?
In fact, when I was doing this talk, I made a quick search for my email <unk> with the phrase, <unk> still <unk>
And several messages came up immediately.
They were from students and journalists and <unk> ones like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where's your <unk>
And I immediately became red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in a international journal, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published an article <unk> for San <unk> that included the experiences of readers when I test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that they both did a public onset together.
<unk> TV interviews, and <unk> the orders of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the <unk> of the <unk> process -- a range for which I didn't feel at all.
And I understand that people didn't want to know if the study was working, they wanted to know if they really <unk> whether they were able to produce love <unk> not just an adventure, but love, real, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel like to respond.
My relationship was just a few months ago, and I felt, mostly that people made the wrong question.
How do you know if we go together or not, and then they <unk>
If the answer was no, I would make the experience of doing these 36 questions at least interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not making romantic love.
Instead, I was looking for systematic systematic attempts between college students, using what they <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds romantic, isn't it?
But the study worked.
<unk> felt closer after doing -- several year studies, they used <unk> protocol -- as a rapid way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have been used by members of the police and the community, and they have used to be used by people with the political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I did last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of eye contact, it was cited in this article, but unfortunately never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a <unk> college university, and then a student came up to me and said to me with <unk> <unk> the studio and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "You want to say you guys from the person with whom you <unk>
Well he did a pause.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, "But they became better friends?
<unk> that I did get better at better after proving the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that neither of you is looking at when it's about love.
I stumbled across the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult loss.
I'd had that relationship since I had 20, which was pretty much of my adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how I could live without him.
So I took it to the science.
I did all that I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could sort of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought I was just studying the book I was writing but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought if I was obsessed with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad as I felt like I felt then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in a different way.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more trust to demand what it looks like.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably me can demand me.
What I look for love is a <unk> not just to be <unk> today and be <unk> tomorrow, but instead of going to be <unk> on the person I love.
It can be that this is the guarantee that people were wondering when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media told about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way for some way to mitigate some of the risk of risk, and this is a very important story, because supporting us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story version I ask, still together?
And their content with an answer of Yes or No.
So more than a question, let's ask you to ask questions more difficult questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How to stay in love when things are going to be <unk> and how do you know when to chop and <unk>
How do you live with the uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how you live with the truth of your <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good start to have a more controversial conversation about what to love someone.
So if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we still keep together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love that's not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my favorite article -- the love didn't happen.
They had fallen in love because we take the choice to be.
And I shudder to read it right now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, I hadn't considered everything I was supposed to do.
I didn't think how many times we would have both going to take that decision, and how much time I will have to continue doing that choice without knowing whether he would have always choice or not.
I want to be enough to have done and answer the question -- if I have chosen to love someone as generous, kind of fun and being expressed that choice in the largest day in the United States.
But what I've done, instead, is turning my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really understand.
And what I think about and what I might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the very happy ending implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't just written.
But what I have in change is the chance to love someone, and hope that he also loved me, and it's frightening, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by <unk> and in a certain way, as a forest <unk>
The city of New York does a while ago.  So something really struck me but more details later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box and a <unk> a dollar bill and a fork on it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some <unk> <unk> or some aliens find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has fun because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment, I was in <unk> <unk> like to go from a trip and try and pasting and all those things <unk> and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took a kind of <unk> <unk> a style of <unk> Martin, the <unk> and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid to be afraid of bees and it is <unk> to them, so I added more <unk> in the canvas, thinking that I could <unk>
Instead, it really happened the opposite: somehow it seemed to rise to size, as if it was <unk> text with a <unk>
So I did? I built more boxes.
This time, I started to add electronic elements, you know, strange bottles that I was finding on the street, all I could find, because I was looking for all my life, trying to figure out and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around objects, and I realized that God of mine can draw in space.
I can rotate it by drawing just like a body on the scene of the crime.
And I took the objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens <unk>
First of all, <unk> that you will be done.
Then I made some insects and weird creatures.
It was really fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to take my girlfriend on dinner, for example, to go to <unk>
It was great, man.
At some point I became interested in the human form to be able to sort of sound out of a natural size of human beings inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because I was going to kill you.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing in the layers of glass, similar to the drawing on a window, and another window, and I had all these windows together that make a three-dimensional composition together.
And this really worked, and I could stop using <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work worked with something very big, I call <unk>
For <unk> I was inspired by <unk> de <unk> of <unk> <unk> which is a painting in the Museum of the <unk> in Spain.
<unk> it.
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11,000 pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It has double faces, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animals travel in between two worlds.
Do you go from the world of representation, to this <unk> mesh <unk> where they <unk>
This is where the creatures with animals are run by <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird god attached to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in <unk> El <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of Osama bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that can be found if you look very well.
In any ways, also sort of a <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand is gone.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in equilibrium.
So it's a aspect of the <unk>
It's a bit of story.
That's the hand I <unk>
And then, when you go to the other hand, it has a <unk> like a bird, and it spits out the clouds of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> queue of <unk> that joins the <unk>
Anyway, their tail <unk> fire onto the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why I did that.
Things that go through, you know.
His tail ends up in a <unk> <unk> <unk> release <unk>
Have you <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards for terrorists.
Very <unk> at his time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
It's about a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a file of our culture, through media and material being <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of archive in a human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at a time.
They're like cells, they come together, <unk>
And you can walk in one of them. I'm getting years.
Each one is basically a microscope <unk> which weighs 1.3 billion pounds of a trapped in its inside.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> chest, can <unk> the <unk>
I'm going to share it for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and that covers the penis or <unk> or whatever it is they have, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick sketch of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a game in half.
This has two heads and they're communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and enter the head of this strange <unk>
There's a little forest scene inside of <unk> <unk>
Can you imagine?
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physical, a neuroscientist, a <unk> a musician a musician -- a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> arm that spreads all the content we do in the world -- and a garden.
They <unk> the box and all of the people in it hits each other as particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that's actually play.
And together we came to realize that we're all together in this, that this delusion that we are different -- these concepts of countries, of the boundaries, doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same stuff and in the same box.
And if we don't start exchanging those things with sweet and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect against pain, first goes through your stomach, <unk> and other organs.
So I'll take a pill is the most effective system and <unk> so that any drug <unk> effect in the body.
The <unk> however, is that the <unk> any drug <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When you take drugs that are <unk> these are <unk> to decrease the number of viruses in the blood, and increase <unk> cells.
But they're also known for their side effects of their side effects on their negative, because in the time it takes it to the current stream -- it will be <unk> and worse even for the time that it takes to get to your destiny, which is where it's more important -- in the oil <unk>
These are regions of the body as the lymph nodes -- the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't go easily into the bloodstream, of the patients that are <unk> to the regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can awaken and infect new rogue cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treating HIV with the current drugs that is a living treatment for life <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, "I will make the treatment directly to the deposit of the virus, without the risk of <unk> of the <unk>
As a scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for wounds and <unk> surgery, you can use it for anything <unk> including transportation <unk>
In fact, we're using hundred-dollar pulses to open or <unk> very small holes, which opens up and down, almost immediately the cells are infected with HIV to introduce medicines.
The best people ask, "How is that <unk>
We sent a little bit of powerful laser beam on the cellular membrane for HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser through the cell, as the cell absorbs a drug <unk>
Before you even notice, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're now testing this technology in vitro or in Petri plates, but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"What is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we're going to do a <unk> on the site of infection.
The second brain, which is a camera, and it heads into the site of infection.
Finally, the third hand, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it releases it directly in the place of infection, as the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of the body.
Yeah. It's a cure for HIV.
This is the dream of every research researcher, in our case, a laser <unk>
Thank you.
In the last decade, I have studied armed groups have not <unk> military organizations like terrorists, <unk> or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to be able to understand these agents of violence in violence and study ways to encourage the transition from violent participation to a confrontation not violent.
I do work work in the field of politics and the library.
Understanding in these groups is key to solve almost every conflict in course, because the war has changed.
I used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between the states and the African actors.
For example, from <unk> peace peace deals with 1975 and 2011, <unk> were signed between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> even we have to <unk> or <unk> in any process of very successful conflict.
But how do you do it?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do, how they do, but nobody really analyzes what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and political <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
<unk> groups today are complex organizations.
For example, <unk> <unk> known for their violent <unk> against Israel.
From his creation in the early 1980s, <unk> has also established a political party and a network of social services and a military device.
In the same way, the Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks in Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make more than just fire.
It's multitasking too.
It <unk> a complex communication machine, radio stations, channels of the Internet and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the printed magazine magazine in English and published in <unk>
<unk> groups also invest in a complex fundraising fundraising but through business <unk> for example, building companies for construction.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to try and build their brand.
<unk> groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population by investing in social services.
They build schools -- they run hospitals, put them hospitals, put professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all of these services and more.
<unk> groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state is not <unk> security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in a Afghanistan ripped through the war, or even the beginning of <unk> <unk> can also be able to look at the efforts of these groups for delivering security.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a <unk> price.
But, in general, providing social services means filling up an empty gap by the government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, Abraham <unk> victory cannot be understood without recognizing the social work.
It's a really complex scenario in the West, even in the West, when we look at <unk> groups just think of the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill <unk> gaps by the government, and they come up with armed and political groups are involved in the violent struggle and give governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated these organizations are organizations, we can even make them as opposed to a state.
How do I call a group like <unk>
<unk> part of a <unk> they run all their <unk> collect the trash system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is it <unk>
The lines <unk>
We live in a world of states, from nations without state and hybrids and the more weak states are states, like in the Middle East and they fill that gap and <unk>
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more than not military tools.
<unk> that government governance has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put peace together.
If we better understand the <unk> we understand better than incentives to foster the transition from violence to violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors don't <unk> the military power can win some <unk> but we don't give us peace or stability.
In order to achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that security, and to fill that governance empty that allowed these groups to thrive in a start.
Thank you.
I'm a failure like a woman and as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality is <unk> but I'm afraid to accept the label of <unk> it would be unfair for <unk>
I'm a painter, but pretty bad.
And so I would love myself as a bad feminist.
Or at least I wrote a paper, and a book called "The infamous <unk> and then in interviews -- people started to call me <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself, and a <unk> <unk> has become something larger.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and 20 years old, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with the men and that they <unk> as though that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated everywhere and anger, in particular, it seems a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using the people to the <unk> who might be a feminist.
Being labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a taboo word.
<unk> me as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is fighting too much <unk> and <unk> to believe that it's the same or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that <unk> woman until it realizes that it's actually that woman and can't imagine someone else.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started accepting that I am, in fact, <unk> and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
They played the same money for the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world as being <unk> of <unk> or violence.
We have a right to use it in an easy way and accessible the contraceptives and services of them.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> <unk> or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have in account our other <unk>
We are not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and human condition, skills and much more.
We have to realize these differences and how we behave the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad core.
I have another confession.
When I'm working at work, I hear music rap <unk> all volume.
Even though the letter degrades the women and it offends me, deeply the classic <unk> classic of the Yin <unk> yang <unk>
<unk> reality with your shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you give you the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely overwhelmed by my musical music.
I firmly believe in the work of the man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, the collection of trash and the maintenance of <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
pink is my favorite color.
<unk> out of fashion magazines and nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the fairy fairy tales that are done.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the last name of her husband, is her choice, and I'm not who for judgment.
If a woman decides to stay home to raise your children, I read that choice as well.
The problem is that it becomes economically vulnerable through this one choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that we make women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
Let's get this problem.
<unk> conventional feminism that has <unk> or <unk> historically, the needs of color women -- gay <unk> and <unk> for women white, <unk> and <unk>
Listen, if that's a really bad feminism -- I'm a very bad <unk>
It also happens to be the following. Like <unk>
Do we have this <unk> trend in a <unk>
We hope that you will keep perfection.
When we get rid of the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I consider that <unk> before I try and put myself there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid to be tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm a fear of fear that it means that we could not be able to fill with little <unk>
Let's take <unk> or I call it the <unk>
In the last few years, it's a <unk>
In <unk> Music <unk> 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> show looking at this star on the pop star, and I want to know the women and the young men who will be a feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, religious critics started endless <unk> if <unk> was or not really feminist.
<unk> its feminism, instead of just believing the word of a adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection -- because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need so <unk> a lot.
We go so much beyond the <unk> <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any woman's woman, until there is nothing.
We don't need to do that.
The bad feminism or more good, more inclusive feminism is the point of <unk>
But what's next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to the day, to go to action and be a little more <unk>
If I hear music <unk> I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to provide a <unk>
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they reduce the change actually affecting their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why has your music that will be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a more choice.
But when bad decisions justify this makes it harder for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve ourselves, and it's our responsibility.
I think of my three and four years.
They are two <unk> <unk> <unk> and also very <unk> I want you to grow up in a world.
Where they relate to the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option would be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program involves sexual violence against women like sport, <unk> the <unk> <unk>
We can change the radio station when we hear songs that treat women like anything.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part when movies treat women more than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting the professional sports where athletes treat their peers as <unk>
In any case, men, especially white men, who can say, "No, I'm not going to post on your magazine, engaging in his project, or working with you, until it doesn't take a number of enough of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but we're going to be involved in this kind of projects, we can also <unk> to be including as much as we are <unk> to the barriers to make a decision <unk>
Because we are no <unk> <unk> Without these <unk> our accomplishments are going to mean very little.
We can make these small acts of bravery and hope that our decisions are going to get to people in the power of CEOs and theater, and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions -- more courageous, to create a lasting change.
We can also affirm our brief, good, bad, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist not to be <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say about everything, because I <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it <unk> to deal with what happened.
A couple of kids struck me when I was very young, and I didn't know kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as though anything.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after everything I couldn't tell me to believe that I could matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I became a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked to me and they understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write as myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, also discovered that if I was a little <unk> another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is the nothing that the world is trying to tell us that we are.
In a hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other hand, I play the <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a <unk> <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to get my way to think, what I say and what I do, without abandoning anything that makes me human.
I hope we all could do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a bit courageous, when you need to be able to <unk>
Right after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had <unk> because he went to <unk> or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border of Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things in this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be <unk> for a child with a immune immune system, it's one of the most <unk> diseases in the world.
There is a effective vaccine for this for over half a century -- but many of the children involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been immunized because their parents were afraid of something allegedly even <unk> autism.
But a moment, it wasn't the article that broke the argument about autism and vaccines and <unk> and <unk> and stored by being an <unk> fraud by the British Medical Foundation.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know what it is, but millions of parents all over the world are still <unk> that vaccines are in order to have autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the autism rise in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and realizing that I had heard about her create a whole professional life without seeing a single case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates are continued so much three or four children for every <unk>
But then, in the 1990s the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> of fundraising <unk> like <unk> <unk> refer to autism as an epidemic as if I could use another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not the vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people from the Center for Disease Control -- what's going on, tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic <unk> and a better detection detection -- to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language is not <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who seeks to the face of his son of two years, the visual contact of the same as the visual contact itself.
If the criteria criteria had to <unk> why they were so <unk> at the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism as difficult to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to find the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and <unk> of the science that you have the sense of storytelling.
During most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had been lost and forgotten in the dark corner of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we got here and where we need to go.
The first story starts with an infant psychiatrist Leo <unk> at <unk> Johns Hopkins Hospital was published at <unk> <unk> <unk> who describes 11 young patients who looked like <unk> worlds <unk> people around their own, even their own parents.
They could amuse it for hours by shaking the hands of his faces, but they were aware of panic by <unk> as when they didn't put their favorite toy in his usual rather than knowing them.
On the basis of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s, as the primary authority of the world in the subject, declared that I had seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome as <unk> <unk> from places as distant as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for diagnosis of autism were very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis to children, but now we know that epilepsy, is very common in autism.
Once it was <unk> that he had become nine out of five children sent by other doctors to her office, to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of <unk> child caused by cold and <unk>
And these kids, he said, they have been carefully kept in a fridge that doesn't <unk>
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of his young girls had special skills that they put in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in your clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I get two.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he properly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, affirming things like the children were just <unk> what they had heard of their parents who had empowered parents to earn their <unk>
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, turning invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s, the researchers started testing the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist, thought that the theory of <unk> <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and her husband -- John was warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like <unk> without service services, without special education, no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National Service, of Health that they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and their colleague Judith <unk> decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They launched a study of prevalence of autism in the general population.
It was a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find the children autistic children in the community.
What you saw, I let the model of <unk> was far too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse <unk>
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, in dinosaurs or in the <unk> of the <unk>
Otherwise these kids didn't fit into beautiful <unk> and <unk> as he said, <unk> and saw a bunch of them, much more than the <unk> model would have predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How did no one didn't realize these kids before?
But then <unk> found a reference to a paper that was published in German in <unk> the year after the <unk> article and then <unk> buried under the <unk> of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> I knew about this article of competition, but he avoided his own work.
There was not even a translation of English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> he talked German, and he was doing it for her.
<unk> offers an alternative history of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a clinic integrated with a internship in Vienna in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in the clinic started with music pairs with music, and kids kept their games on the expense on the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as disability as a <unk> disability required to support support and <unk> spaces over the course of life.
Instead of treating the kids in their clinic as patients, <unk> called them their little teachers, and he helped them to help in the development of education methods that were especially suited for them.
<unk> <unk> saw autism as a diverse diverse and diverse continuous array of both and disability.
He believed that autism and male traits were common and they have always been, seeing aspects of this continuum in funeral known in pop culture as a awkward social scientist, and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say that for success in science and art, an ounce of autism is critical.
<unk> and Judith found out that <unk> was wrong in that autism was <unk> so the parents were the <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnosis that was experiencing the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
At the end of the '80s and early '90s, their changes in <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> for a broad and <unk> model.
These changes not fell in a broken broken.
<unk> when we <unk> and Judith worked in conjunction -- to reform these <unk> people around the world to see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before we got <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a small circle, <unk> by experts knew what the autism, but after <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and parents from everybody else knew what autism was.
At the same time, they were introduced to the first easy drug <unk> to use to diagnose autism.
I couldn't have a connection with that little <unk> circle to get a diagnosis for your son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of the substance of autism.
The number of diagnostics started <unk> the same as they predicted <unk> and <unk> of fact that they were expecting to be there, so they get people with autism and their families finally support support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame the vaccine for the rise of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> credible history as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the prevention of <unk> that one in 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, it's right, the <unk> are one of the largest <unk> groups in the world.
In the last few years, people who are autistic people have joined the Internet to refuse the idea that these are the puzzles to solve by the new breakthroughs by doctors, <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think of terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with <unk> doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and they suffer from a deficit <unk>
<unk> people are autistic who have a hard time to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still catching <unk> that believed that the <unk> for the most severe aspects, are found in the realization of teachers, employers who are struggling with capacity, and parents with faith in the potential for their children.
One autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands in cover to <unk> the ship of <unk>
As we <unk> towards an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to deal with the challenges that we face as a society.
We cannot afford to lose a brain.
Thank you.
